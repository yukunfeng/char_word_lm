# Injecting Word-level Information into Character-aware NLMs
Pytorch Implementation of CoNLL 2019 paper [A Simple and Effective Method for Injecting Word-level
Information into Character-aware Neural Language Models] (not_available_yet)
 
# Requirements
- Python version >= 3.5
- Pytorch version 0.4.0

# Datasets
Originally downloaded from [here](http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/dsg40/lmmrl.html) from [this
paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q18-1032.pdf). Currently the link seems broken and I have
uploaded one English dataset for testing under 'data' directory. 

# Usage
Run the following command to see the details.
```
python ./main.py -h
```

# Run experiments
Run the following command to directly run an experiment. See more in this script to reproduce the
result reported in the paper.
```
sh run.sh
