From Geneva , the party moved to Paris .
Here Smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time ; invariably having an effect on his future works .
So impressed with his ideas Smith considered dedicating The Wealth of Nations to him – had Quesnay not died beforehand .
Physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism , the dominating economic theory of the time .
Illustrated in their motto Laissez faire et laissez passer , le monde va de lui même !
( Let do and let pass , the world goes on by itself ! ) .
They were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth ; merchants and industrialists ( manufacturers ) did not .
The distinction between productive versus unproductive labour – the physiocratic classe steril – was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory .
Later years In 1766 , Henry Scott 's younger brother died in Paris , and Smith 's tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter .
Smith returned home that year to Kirkcaldy , and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus .
There he befriended Henry Moyes , a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude .
As well as teaching Moyes , Smith secured the patronage of David Hume and Thomas Reid in the young man 's education .
In May 1773 , Smith was elected fellow of the Royal Society of London , and was elected a member of the Literary Club in 1775 .
The Wealth of Nations was published in 1776 and was an instant success , selling out its first edition in only six months .
In 1778 , Smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in Scotland and went to live with his mother in Panmure House in Edinburgh 's Canongate .
He died in the northern wing of Panmure House in Edinburgh on 17 July 1790 after a painful illness and was buried in the Canongate Kirkyard .
On his death bed , Smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more .
Smith 's literary executors were two friends from the Scottish academic world : the physicist and chemist Joseph Black , and the pioneering geologist James Hutton .
Smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material , but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication .
He mentioned an early unpublished History of Astronomy as probably suitable , and it duly appeared in 1795 , along with other material such as Essays on Philosophical Subjects .
It was eventually divided between his two surviving children , Cecilia Margaret ( Mrs. Cunningham ) and David Anne ( Mrs. Bannerman ) .
On the death of her husband , the Rev. W. B. Cunningham of Prestonpans in 1878 , Mrs. Cunningham sold some of the books .
The remainder passed to her son , Professor Robert Oliver Cunningham of Queen 's College , Belfast , who presented a part to the library of Queen 's College .
After his death the remaining books were sold .
On the death of Mrs. Bannerman in 1879 her portion of the library went intact to the New College ( of the Free Church ) , Edinburgh .
Personality and beliefs Character Not much is known about Smith 's personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles .
His personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request .
He was known to talk to himself , a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions .
He also had occasional spells of imaginary illness , and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study .
According to another account , Smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up outside of town , before nearby church bells brought him back to reality .
According to Boswell , he once told Sir Joshua Reynolds that ' he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood ' .
Smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point , saying , " I am a beau in nothing but my books . "
Smith rarely sat for portraits , so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory .
The best-known portraits of Smith are the profile by James Tassie and two etching s by John Kay .
The line engravings produced for the covers of 19th century reprints of The Wealth of Nations were based largely on Tassie 's medallion .
Religious views There has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of Smith 's religious views .
Smith 's father had shown a strong interest in Christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the Church of Scotland .
The fact that Adam Smith received the Snell Exhibition suggests that he may have gone to Oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the Church of England .
It is generally believed that at Oxford Smith rejected Christianity , returning to Scotland a deist .
Philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them , from more familiar causes , or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods " .
Smith was also a close friend and later the executor of David Hume , who was commonly characterized in his own time as an atheist .
Published works The Theory of Moral Sentiments In 1759 , Smith published his first work , The Theory of Moral Sentiments .
He continued making extensive revisions to the book , up until his death .
In the work , Smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time , and suggests that conscience arises from social relationships .
His goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankind 's ability to form moral judgements , in spite of man 's natural inclinations towards self-interest .
Smith proposes a theory of sympathy , in which the act of observing others makes people aware of themselves and the morality of their own behavior .
In recent years , however , some scholars of Smith 's work have argued that no contradiction exists .
which ensures that the gluttony of the rich helps the poor , as the stomachs of rich are so limited that they have to spend their fortune on servants .
After his visit to France , Smith considers in the Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) the gluttony of the rich as unproductive labour .
This last statement about " an invisible hand " has been interpreted as " the invisible hand " in numerous ways .
He generally , indeed , neither intends to promote the public interest , nor knows how much he is promoting it .
Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it .
By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it .
I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good .
It is an affectation , indeed , not very common among merchants , and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it .
We address ourselves , not to their humanity but to their self-love , and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages .
It shows Smith 's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest , he indirectly promotes the good of society .
Nevertheless , he was wary of businessmen and warned of their " conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices " .
Smith also warned that a business-dominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers , with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation .
Samuelson 's " Economics " refers 6 times to Smith 's " invisible hand " .
To emphasize this relation , Samuelson quotes Smith 's " invisible hand " statement putting " general interest " where Smith wrote " publick interest " .
Samuelson concluded : " Smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisible-hand doctrine .
Indeed , until the 1940s no one knew how to prove , even to state properly , the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market . "
Very differently , classical economists see in Smith 's first sentences his programme to promote " The Wealth of Nations " .
Taking up the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period2 must excel the inputs of period1 .
Therefore the outputs of period1 not used or usable as input of period2 are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth .
This is what Smith had learned in France with Quesnay .
Deepening the division of labour means under competition lower prices and thereby extended markets .
Extended markets and increased production lead to a new step of reorganising production and inventing new ways of producing which again lower prices , etc. , etc. .
Smith 's central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures " The Wealth of Nations " .
It predicted England 's evolution as the workshop of the World , underselling all its competitors .
[ T ] his produce ... bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it ... .
What we would call capitalism he despised .
People read snippets of Adam Smith , the few phrases they teach in school .
Everybody reads the first paragraph of The Wealth of Nations where he talks about how wonderful the division of labor is .
And therefore in any civilized society the government is going to have to take some measures to prevent division of labor from proceeding to its limits . "
Other works Shortly before his death , Smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed .
Legacy In economics and moral philosophy The Wealth of Nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics .
In this and other works , Smith expounded how rational self-interest and competition can lead to economic prosperity .
In 2005 , The Wealth of Nations was named among the 100 Best Scottish Books of all time .
Former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , it is said , used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag .
George Stigler attributes to Smith " the most important substantive proposition in all of economics " .
On the other hand , Joseph Schumpeter dismissed Smith 's contributions as unoriginal , saying " His very limitation made for success .
Had he been more brilliant , he would not have been taken so seriously .
Had he dug more deeply , had he unearthed more recondite truth , had he used more difficult and ingenious methods , he would not have been understood .
But he had no such ambitions ; in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense .
He never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers .
He led them on gently , encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations , making them feel comfortable all along . "
Classical economists presented competing theories of those of Smith , termed the " labour theory of value " .
Later Marxian economics descending from classical economics also use Smith 's labour theories , in part .
The first volume of Karl Marx 's major work , Capital , was published in German in 1867 .
In it , Marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital .
The labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labor that went into its production .
The body of theory later termed " neoclassical economics " or " marginalism " formed from about 1870 to 1910 .
His homo economicus or " economic man " was also more often represented as a moral person .
They show the caricatures of Smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article .
Emphasized also are Smith 's statements of the need for high wages for the poor , and the efforts to keep wages low .
They also cite Smith 's opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense .
Wherever there is great property there is great inequality .
For one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor , and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many .
The affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor , who are often both driven by want , and prompted by envy , to invade his possessions .
The acquisition of valuable and extensive property , therefore , necessarily requires the establishment of civil government .
Where there is no property , or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days ' labour , civil government is not so necessary .
Civil government supposes a certain subordination .
A large-scale memorial of Smith by Alexander Stoddart was unveiled on 4 July 2008 in Edinburgh .
It is a - tall bronze sculpture and it stands above the Royal Mile outside St Giles ' Cathedral in Parliament Square , near the Mercat cross .
20th century sculptor Jim Sanborn ( best known for the Kryptos sculpture at the United States Central Intelligence Agency ) has created multiple pieces which feature Smith 's work .
At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte , outside the Belk College of Business Administration , is Adam Smith 's Spinning Top .
Another Smith sculpture is at Cleveland State University .
Residence Adam Smith resided at Panmure house from 1778-90 .
This residence has now been purchased by the Edinburgh Business School at Heriot Watt University and fundraising has begun to restore it .
Part of the Northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the 19th century to make way for an iron foundry .
Greenspan continues that The Wealth of Nations was " one of the great achievements in human intellectual history " .
P. J. O'Rourke describes Smith as the " founder of free market economics " .
However , other writers have argued that Smith 's support for laissez-faire ( which in French means leave alone ) has been overstated .
Stein writes that Smith " was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea .
He did not wear the Adam Smith necktie . "
Additionally , Smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in The Wealth of Nations , Book V , Ch .
He also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies .
he supported public education and religious institutions as providing general benefit to the society .
Finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate , such that they are equal or above the public in fashion .
In addition , he was in favor of retaliatory tariffs and believed that they would eventually bring down the price of goods .
Chomsky argues that Smith supported markets in the belief that they would lead to equality , and that Smith opposed wage labor and corporations .
Economist David Ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about Smith 's thoughts on free market .
Most people still fall victim to the thinking that Smith was a free market economist without exception , though he was not .
Ricardo pointed out that Smith was in support of helping infant industries .
Smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good .
Smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defense .
Some have also claimed , Emma Rothschild among them , that Smith supported a minimum wage .
Many workmen could not subsist a week , few could subsist a month , and scarce any a year without employment .
In the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him ; but the necessity is not so immediate .
He named both oxygen ( 1778 ) and hydrogen ( 1783 ) and predicted silicon ( 1787 ) .
He helped construct the metric system , put together the first extensive list of elements , and helped to reform chemical nomenclature .
He was also the first to establish that sulfur was an element ( 1777 ) rather than a compound .
He discovered that , although matter may change its form or shape , its mass always remains the same .
He was an administrator of the Ferme Générale and a powerful member of a number of other aristocratic councils .
All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research .
Benjamin Franklin was familiar with Antoine , as they were both members of the " Benjamin Franklin inquiries " into Mesmer and animal magnetism .
Early life Born to a wealthy family in Paris , Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier inherited a large fortune at the age of five with the passing of his mother .
He was educated at the Collège des Quatre-Nations ( also known as Collège Mazarin ) from 1754 to 1761 , studying chemistry , botany , astronomy , and mathematics .
He was expected to follow in his father 's footsteps and even obtained his license to practice law in 1764 before turning to a life of science .
His education was filled with the ideals of the French Enlightenment of the time , and he was fascinated by Pierre Macquer 's dictionary of chemistry .
He attended lectures in the natural sciences .
Lavoisier 's devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by Étienne Condillac , a prominent French scholar of the 18th century .
His first chemical publication appeared in 1764 .
From 1763 to 1767 , he studied geology under Jean-Étienne Guettard .
In collaboration with Guettard , Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of Alsace-Lorraine in June 1767 .
In 1769 , he worked on the first geological map of France .
In 1771 , at the age of 28 , Lavoisier married 13-year-old Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze , the daughter of a co-owner of the Ferme générale .
Over time , she proved to be a scientific colleague to her husband .
She translated English documents for him , including Richard Kirwan 's Essay on Phlogiston and Joseph Priestley 's research .
She created many sketches and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues .
Working with Pierre-Simon Laplace , Lavoisier conducted experiments that showed that respiration was essentially a slow combustion of organic material using inhaled oxygen .
Lavoisier 's explanation of combustion disproved the phlogiston theory , which postulated that materials released a substance called phlogiston when they burned .
In " Réflexions sur le phlogistique " ( " Reflections on Phlogiston , " 1783 ) , Lavoisier showed the phlogiston theory to be inconsistent .
But Priestley refused to believe Lavoisier 's results before his death .
Pioneer of stoichiometry Lavoisier 's researches included some of the first truly quantitative chemical experiments .
He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel , which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry .
Thus , for instance , if a piece of wood is burned to ashes , the total mass remains unchanged .
Analytical chemistry and chemical nomenclature Lavoisier investigated the composition of water and air , which at the time were considered elements .
He determined that the components of water were oxygen and hydrogen , and that air was a mixture of gases , primarily nitrogen and oxygen .
With the French chemists Claude-Louis Berthollet , Antoine Fourcroy and Guyton de Morveau , Lavoisier devised a systematic chemical nomenclature .
He described it in Méthode de nomenclature chimique ( Method of Chemical Nomenclature , 1787 ) .
It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry , contained a clear statement of the law of conservation of mass , and denied the existence of phlogiston .
In any event , the Traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation .
Legacy Lavoisier 's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory .
Lavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with Laplace .
He also introduced the possibility of allotropy in chemical elements when he discovered that diamond is a crystalline form of carbon .
However , much to his professional detriment , Lavoisier discovered no new substances , devised no really novel apparatus , and worked out no improved methods of preparation .
He completed the work of Black , Priestley and Cavendish , and gave a correct explanation of their experiments .
Overall , his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century .
Contributions to biology Lavoisier used a calorimeter to measure heat production as a result of respiration in a guinea pig .
The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow , which melted to maintain a constant temperature of around an inner shell filled with ice .
The guinea pig in the center of the chamber produced heat which melted the ice .
The water that flowed out of the calorimeter was collected and weighed .
Lavoisier used this measurement to estimate the heat produced by the guinea pig 's metabolism .
Lavoisier concluded , " la respiration est donc une combustion , " that is , respiratory gas exchange is a combustion , like that of a candle burning .
Law and politics Lavoisier received a law degree and was admitted to the bar , but never practiced as a lawyer .
While in government work , he helped develop the metric system to secure uniformity of weights and measures throughout France .
He was branded a traitor by the Assembly under Robespierre , during the Reign of Terror , in 1794 .
Lavoisier was tried , convicted , and guillotined on 8 May in Paris , at the age of 50 .
Lavoisier was actually one of the few liberals in his position , although all tax collectors were executed during the Revolution .
( " The Republic needs neither scientists nor chemists ; the course of justice can not be delayed . " )
( " It took them only an instant to cut off his head , but France may not produce another such head in a century . " )
One and a half years after his death , Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government .
When his private belongings were delivered to his widow , a brief note was included , reading " To the widow of Lavoisier , who was falsely convicted " .
About a century after his death , a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris .
Lack of money prevented alterations from being made .
The statue was melted down during the Second World War and has not since been replaced .

Adolph Wilhelm Hermann Kolbe ( September 27 , 1818 – November 25 , 1884 ) was a German chemist .
He never used the first two of his given names , preferring to be known as Hermann Kolbe .
Life Kolbe was born in Elliehausen , near Göttingen , Kingdom of Hanover ( Germany ) as the eldest son of a Protestant pastor .
At the age of 13 he entered the Göttingen Gymnasium , residing at the home of one of the professors .
He obtained the leaving certificate ( the Abitur ) six years later .
In 1842 he became an assistant to Robert Bunsen at the University of Marburg ; he took his doctoral degree there in 1843 .
In 1851 Kolbe succeeded Bunsen as professor of chemistry at Marburg , and in 1865 he was called to the University of Leipzig .
In 1864 , he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences .
In 1853 he married Charlotte , the daughter of General-Major Wilhelm von Bardeleben .
His wife died in 1876 after 23 years of happy marriage .
They had four children .
Kolbe developed the idea that organic compound s could be derived from inorganic ones , directly or indirectly , by substitution processes .
He validated his theory by converting carbon disulfide , in several steps , to acetic acid ( 1843 – 45 ) .
Introducing a modified idea of structural radicals , he contributed to the establishment of structural theory .
A certain method for the synthesis of nitriles is called the Kolbe nitrile synthesis .
Hermann Kolbe was the first person to use the word synthesis in the present day meaning .
With Edward Frankland he found that nitrile s can be hydrolyzed to the corresponding acids .
He died of a heart attack , in Leipzig .
Amitabh Harivansh Bachchan ( ; 11 October 1942 ) is an Indian film actor .
Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema .
So total was his dominance of the movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director Francois Truffaut called him a " one-man industry ” .
He occupied the top slot of Box Office Indias Top Actors list for a record ( shared with Dilip Kumar ) sixteen consecutive years .
He is the most-nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare , with 37 nominations overall .
In addition to acting , Bachchan has worked as a playback singer , film producer and television presenter .
He also had a stint in politics in the 1980s .
The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984 and the Padma Bhushan in 2001 for his contributions towards the arts .
Early and personal life Bachchan was born in Allahabad , Uttar Pradesh , in north central India .
His father , Harivansh Rai Bachchan , was a Hindi poet and his mother , Teji Bachchan , was a Sikh from Faisalabad ( now in Pakistan ) .
Bachchan was initially named Inquilaab , inspired from the phrase made famous during the Indian independence struggle , Inquilab Zindabad , which means " long live revolution " .
Bachchan 's father died in 2003 and his mother in 2007 .
Amitabh is the elder of Harivansh Rai Bachchan 's two sons , the second being Ajitabh .
His mother had a keen interest in theatre and had been offered a role in a film , but preferred her domestic duties .
She had some degree of influence in Bachchan 's choice of career because she always insisted that he should take the centre stage .
Bachchan is married to actress Jaya Bhaduri .
They have two children , Shweta Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan .
Abhishek is also an actor and is married to actress Aishwarya Rai .
Career Early work : 1969 – 1972 Bachchan made his film debut in 1969 as a voice narrator in Mrinal Sen 's National Award winning film Bhuvan Shome .
Though the film was not a financial success , Bachchan won his first National Film Award for Best Newcomer .
Anand ( 1971 ) followed , where he starred alongside Rajesh Khanna .
Bachchan 's role as a doctor with a cynical view of life garnered him his first Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award .
He then played his first negative role as an infatuated lover-turned-murderer in Parwaana ( 1971 ) .
This was followed by several films including Reshma Aur Shera ( 1971 ) .
During this time , he made a guest appearance in the film Guddi which starred his future wife Jaya Bhaduri .
He narrated part of the film Bawarchi .
In 1972 , he made an appearance in the road action comedy Bombay to Goa , directed by S. Ramanathan .
Many of his films during this early period did not do well , but that was about to change .
Rise to stardom : 1973 – 1983 Director Prakash Mehra cast him in the leading role for the film Zanjeer ( 1973 ) as Inspector Vijay Khanna .
Filmfare considers this one of the iconic performances of Bollywood history .
From then onwards , Bachchan became one of the most successful leading men of the film industry .
He earned his first Filmfare nomination for Best Actor for Zanjeer .
His supporting role won him his second Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award .
In 1974 , Bachchan made several guest appearances in films such as Kunwara Baap and Dost , before playing a supporting role in Roti Kapda Aur Makaan .
Bachchan then played the leading role in film Majboor , released on 6 December 1974 , which was a remake of the Hollywood film Zig Zag .
The film was a success at the box office .
Two of his other releases that year viz .
Kasauti and Benaam also made money making his success at the box office consistent .
In 1975 , he starred in a variety of film genres from the comedy Chupke Chupke , the crime drama Faraar to the romantic drama Mili .
1975 was the year when he appeared in two films which are regarded as important in Hindi cinematic history .
The film became a major hit at the box office in 1975 , ranking in at number 4 .
Indiatimes Movies ranks Deewaar amongst the Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films .
Bachchan played the role of Jaidev .
In that same year , the judges of the 50th annual Filmfare Awards awarded it with the special distinction award called Filmfare Best Film of 50 Years .
Bachchan starred in comedies such as Chupke Chupke ( 1975 ) and Amar Akbar Anthony ( 1977 ) and in films such as Kabhie Kabhie ( 1976 ) .
The film was notable for portraying Bachchan as a romantic hero , a far cry from his " angry young man " roles like Zanjeer and Deewar .
The film evoked a favourable response from critics and audiences alike .
Bachchan was again nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for his role in the film .
The film was the highest grossing film of that year .
His other successes that year include Parvarish , Khoon Pasina and Adalat .
His performance won him his second Filmfare Best Actor Award .
He also gave towering performances in Trishul and Muqaddar Ka Sikandar both of which earned him further Filmfare Best Actor nominations .
In 1979 , Bachchan starred in Suhaag which was the highest earning film of that year .
In the same year he also enjoyed critical acclaim and commercial success with films like Mr. Natwarlal and Kaala Patthar .
Amitabh was required to use his singing voice for the first time in a song from the film Mr. Natwarlal in which he starred alongside Rekha .
Dostana proved to be the top grossing film of 1980 .
In 1981 , he starred in Yash Chopra 's melodrama film Silsila , where he starred alongside his wife Jaya and Rekha .
Bachchan was performing his own stunts in the film and one scene required him to fall onto a table and then on the ground .
He required an emergency splenectomy and remained critically ill in hospital for many months , at times close to death .
Nevertheless , he spent many months recovering and resumed filming later that year after a long period of recuperation .
The director , Manmohan Desai , altered the ending of Coolie after Bachchan 's accident .
Bachchan 's character was originally intended to have been killed off but after the change of script , the character lived in the end .
It would have been inappropriate , said Desai , for the man who had just fended off death in real life to be killed on screen .
Later , he was diagnosed with Myasthenia gravis .
His illness made him feel weak both mentally and physically and he decided to quit films and venture into politics .
( " This film will flop " ) .
Politics : 1984 – 87 In 1984 , Bachchan took a break from acting and briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend , Rajiv Gandhi .
His political career , however , was short-lived : he resigned after three years , calling politics a cesspool .
The resignation followed the implication of Bachchan and his brother in the " Bofors scandal " by a newspaper , which he vowed to take to court .
Bachchan was eventually found not guilty of involvement in the ordeal .
His old friend , Amar Singh , helped him during a financial crisis due to the failure of his company ABCL .
Therefore Bachchan started to support Amar Singh 's political party , the Samajwadi party .
Jaya Bachchan joined the Samajwadi Party and became a Rajya Sabha member .
Bachchan has continued to do favors for the Samajwadi party , including advertisements and political campaigns .
A 15 year press ban against Bachchan was imposed during his peak acting years by Stardust and some of the other film magazines .
In his own defense , Bachchan claimed to have banned the press from entering his sets until late 1989 .
Slump and retirement : 1988 – 1992 In 1988 , Bachchan returned to films , playing the title role in Shahenshah , which was a box office success .
After the success of his comeback film however , his star power began to wane as all of his subsequent films failed at the box office .
These years would be the last he would be seen on screen for some time .
After the release of Khuda Gawah in 1992 , Bachchan went into semi-retirement for five years .
ABCL 's strategy was to introduce products and services covering the entire section of the India 's entertainment industry .
Its operations were mainstream commercial film production and distribution , audio cassettes and video discs , production and marketing of television software , celebrity and event management .
ABCL produced a few other films , none of which did well .
In 1997 , Bachchan attempted to make his acting comeback with the film Mrityudata , produced by ABCL .
Though Mrityudaata attempted to reprise Bachchan 's earlier success as an action hero , the film was a failure both financially and critically .
ABCL was the main sponsor of the 1996 Miss World beauty pageant , Bangalore but lost millions .
The company went into administration and was later declared a failed company by Indian Industries board .
Bachchan had , however , pleaded that he had mortgaged his bungalow to raise funds for his company .
Return to prominence : 2000 – present In 2000 , Amitabh Bachchan appeared in Yash Chopra 's box-office hit , Mohabbatein , directed by Aditya Chopra .
He played a stern , older figure that rivalled the character of Shahrukh Khan .
His role won him his third Filmfare Best Supporting Actor Award .
One project that did particularly well for Bachchan was Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's Black ( 2005 ) .
The film starred Bachchan as an aging teacher of a deaf-blind girl and followed their relationship .
His performance was unanimously praised by critics and audiences and won him his second National Film Award for Best Actor and fourth Filmfare Best Actor Award .
Taking advantage of this resurgence , Amitabh began endorsing a variety of products and services , appearing in many television and billboard advertisements .
All of them were successful at the box office .
In May 2007 , two of his films Cheeni Kum and the multi-starrer Shootout at Lokhandwala were released .
The year also marked Bachchan 's first appearance in an English-language film , Rituparno Ghosh 's The Last Lear .
The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival on 9 September 2007 .
He received positive reviews from critics who hailed his performance as his best ever since Black .
Bachchan was slated to play a supporting role in his first international film , Shantaram , directed by Mira Nair and starring Hollywood actor Johnny Depp in the lead .
The film was due to begin filming in February 2008 but due to the writer 's strike , was pushed to September 2008 .
The film is currently " shelved " indefinitely .
Vivek Sharma 's Bhoothnath , in which he plays the title role as a ghost , was released on 9 May 2008 .
Sarkar Raj , the sequel of the 2005 film Sarkar , released in June 2008 and received a positive response at the box-office .
It won him his third National Film Award for Best Actor and fifth Filmfare Best Actor Award .
In 2010 , he debuted in Malayalam film through Kandahar , directed by Major Ravi and co-starring Mohanlal .
The film was based on the hijacking incident of the Indian Airlines Flight 814 .
Bachchan did not receive any remuneration for this film .
Television career In 2000 , Bachchan hosted India 's adaptation of the British television game show , Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ?
entitled , Kaun Banega Crorepati .
As it did in most other countries where it was adopted , the program found immediate success .
He has hosted all but one of the seasons of the show .
Canara Bank withdrew its law suit against Bachchan in November 2000 .
Bachchan hosted KBC till November 2005 , when he fell ill .
At that time he was admitted to Lilavati Hospital 's ICU once more , to undergo surgery for diverticulitis of the small intestine .
During the period and that following his recovery , most of his projects were put on hold , including KBC .
The show 's success set the stage for his return to film popularity .

In linguistics , an allomorph is a variant form of a morpheme .
The concept occurs when a unit of meaning can vary in sound without changing meaning .
The term allomorph explains the comprehension of phonological variations for specific morphemes .
Allomorphy in English suffixes English has several morphemes that vary in sound but not in meaning .
Examples include the past tense and the plural morphemes .
For example , in English , a past tense morpheme is - ed .
Stem allomorphy Allomorphy can also exist in stems or roots , as in Classical Sanskrit : There are three allomorphs of the stem : , and .
The allomorphs are conditioned by the particular case-marking suffixes .
The form of the stem , found in the nominative singular and locative plural , is the etymological form of the morpheme .
Pre-Indic palatalization of velars resulted in the variant form , which was initially phonologically conditioned .
This conditioning can still be seen in the Locative Singular form , where the is followed by the high front vowel .
Hence , this allomorphy was no longer directly relatable to phonological processes .
Phonological conditioning also accounts for the form found in the Instrumental Plural , where the assimilates in voicing to the following .
History The term was originally used to describe variations in chemical structure .
It was first applied to language ( in writing ) in 1948 , by Fatih Şat and Sibel Merve in Language XXIV .
For example , ( as in pin ) and ( as in spin ) are allophones for the phoneme in the English language .
Although a phoneme 's allophones are all alternative pronunciations for a phoneme , the specific allophone selected in a given situation is often predictable .
History of concept The term " allophone " was coined by Benjamin Lee Whorf in the 1940s .
In doing so , he placed a cornerstone in consolidating early phoneme theory .
This has led to some debate over how real , and how universal , phonemes really are ( see phoneme for details ) .
Only some of the variation is significant ( i.e. , detectable or perceivable ) to speakers .
In the case of complementary allophones , each allophone is used in a specific phonetic context and may be involved in a phonological process .
In other cases , the speaker is able to select freely from free variant allophones , based on personal habit or preference .
Allotone A tonic allophone is sometimes called an allotone , for example in the neutral tone of Mandarin .
English speakers treat them as the same sound , but they are different : the first is aspirated and the second is unaspirated ( plain ) .
Plain also occurs as the p in cap , or the second p in paper .
Chinese languages treat these two phones differently ; for example in Mandarin , ( written b in Pinyin ) and ( written p ) contrast phonemically .
Because the choice of allophone is seldom under conscious control , people may not realize they exist .
The difference can also be felt by holding the hand in front of the lips .
Allophones of English may be noticed if the ' light ' of leaf is contrasted with the ' dark ' of feel .
Allophony of " v-w " in Hindustani A reverse example is that of versus in Hindustani .
These are distinct phonemes in English , but both allophones of the phoneme / व / ( or / و / ) in Hindustani .
However , the allophone phenomenon becomes obvious when speakers switch languages .
When non-native speakers speak Hindustani , they might pronounce / व / in ' व्रत ' as , i.e. as wrat instead of the correct vrat .
This results in an intelligibility problem because wrat can easily be confused for aurat , which means woman instead of fast in Hindustani .
Representing a phoneme with an allophone Since phonemes are abstractions of speech sounds , not the sounds themselves , they have no direct phonetic transcription .
When they are realized without much allophonic variation , a simple ( i.e. ' broad ' ) transcription is used .
However , when there are complementary allophones of a phoneme , so that the allophony is significant , things become more complicated .
Often , if only one of the allophones is simple to transcribe , in the sense of not requiring diacritics , then that representation is chosen for the phoneme .
However , there may be several such allophones , or the linguist may prefer greater precision than this allows .
In such cases a common convention is to use the " elsewhere condition " to decide which allophone will stand for the phoneme .
The " elsewhere " allophone is the one that remains once the conditions for the others are described by phonological rules .
For example , English has both oral and nasal allophones of its vowels .
The pattern is that vowels are nasal only when preceding a nasal consonant within the same syllable ; elsewhere they 're oral .
Therefore , by the " elsewhere " convention , the oral allophones are considered basic ; nasal vowels in English are considered to be allophones of oral phonemes .
In rare cases a linguist may represent phonemes with abstract symbols , such as dingbat s , so as not to privilege any one allophone .
An affix is a morpheme that is attached to a word stem to form a new word .
Affixes may be derivational , like English - ness and pre - , or inflection al , like English plural - s and past tense - ed .
They are bound morpheme s by definition ; prefixes and suffixes may be separable affix es .
Positional categories of affixes Affixes are divided into plenty of categories , depending on their position with reference to the stem .
Prefix and suffix are extremely common terms .
Infix and circumfix are less so , as they are not important in European languages .
The other terms are uncommon .
Prefix and suffix may be subsumed under the term adfix in contrast to infix .
Affixes which disrupt the stem , or which themselves are discontinuous , are often marked off with angle brackets .
Reduplication is often shown with a tilde .
Affixes which can not be segmented are marked with a back slash .
Although similar to incorporated nouns , lexical affixes differ in that they never occur as freestanding nouns , i.e. they always appear as affixes .
Lexical affixes are relatively rare .
The Wakashan , Salishan , and Chimakuan languages all have lexical suffixes — the presence of these is an areal feature of the Pacific Northwest of the North America .
The lexical suffixes of these languages often show little to no resemblance to free nouns with similar meanings .
In other cases , the lexical suffixes have become grammaticalized to various degrees .
Some linguists have claimed that these lexical suffixes provide only adverbial or adjectival notions to verbs .
Other linguists disagree arguing that they may additionally be syntactic arguments just as free nouns are and thus equating lexical suffixes with incorporated nouns .
The subject " the woman " is and the object " the baby " is .
In this sentence , " the baby " is a free noun .
( The here is an auxiliary , which can be ignored for explanatory purposes . )
In sentence ( 2 ) , " baby " does not appear as a free noun .
Orthographic affixes In orthography , the terms for affixes may be used for the smaller elements of conjunct characters .
For example , Maya glyphs are generally compounds of a main sign and smaller affixes joined at its margins .
A small glyph placed inside another is called an infix .
Similar terminology is found with the conjunct consonants of the Indic alphabets .
For example , the Tibetan alphabet utilizes prefix , suffix , superfix , and subfix consonant letters .
Allegory is a literary device in which characters or events in a literary , visual , or musical art form represent or symbolize ideas and concepts .
An allegory conveys its hidden message through symbol ic figures , actions , imagery , and/or events .
Allegory is generally treated as a figure of rhetoric ; a rhetorical allegory is a demonstrative form of representation conveying meaning other than the words that are spoken .
As a literary device , an allegory in its most general sense is an extended metaphor .
One of the best known examples is Plato 's " Allegory of the Cave . "
In this allegory , there are a group of people who have lived chained to the wall of a cave all of their lives , facing a blank wall .
The people watch shadows projected on the wall by things passing in front of a fire behind them , and begin to ascribe forms to these shadows .
According to the allegory , the shadows are as close as the prisoners get to viewing reality .
Many ancient religions are based on an astrological allegories , that is , allegories of the movement of the Sun and the Moon as seen from the Earth .
Examples include the cult of Horus / Isis .
Medieval allegory Medieval thinking accepted allegory as having a reality underlying any rhetorical or fictional uses .
The allegory was as true as the facts of surface appearances .
Modern allegory Since meaningful stories are nearly always applicable to larger issues , allegories may be read into many stories , sometimes misinterpreting their author 's intent .
For instance , many people have suggested that The Lord of the Rings is an allegory for the World Wars .
If the requirement of realism is set aside , allegory can often be easily seen .
Some examples of this are : Examples by genre Not every resonant work of modern fiction is an allegory .
L. Frank Baum 's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is plot-driven fantasy narrative in an extended fable with talking animals and broadly-sketched characters .
An allegorical poem has two meanings - a literal meaning and a symbolic meaninig .
Some unique specimens of allegory in poetry can be found in the following works : Gallery File : Titian - Allegorie der Zeit .

Allotropes are different structural modifications of an element ; the atoms of the element are bonded together in a different manner .
The term allotropy is used for elements only , not for compounds .
The more general term , used for any crystalline material , is polymorphism .
History The concept of allotropy was originally proposed in 1841 by the Swedish scientist Baron Jöns Jakob Berzelius ( 1779 – 1848 ) .
The term is derived from the Greek ( allotropia ; variability , changeableness ) .
In the early 20th century it was recognized that other cases such as carbon were due to differences in crystal structure .
Although many other chemists have repeated this advice , IUPAC and most chemistry texts still favour the usage of allotrope and allotropy for elements only .
Differences in properties of an element 's allotropes Allotropes are different structural forms of the same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours .
The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures , i.e. pressure , light , and temperature .
Therefore the stability of the particular allotropes depends on particular conditions .
List of allotropes Typically , elements capable of variable coordination number and/or oxidation states tend to exhibit greater numbers of allotropic forms .
Another contributing factor is the ability of an element to catenate .

Biography Agathocles was born at Thermae Himera eae ( modern name Termini Imerese ) in Sicily .
The son of a potter who had moved to Syracuse in about 343 BC , he learned his father 's trade , but afterwards entered the army .
In 333 BC he married the widow of his patron Damas , a distinguished and wealthy citizen .
He was twice banished for attempting to overthrow the oligarchical party in Syracuse .
In 317 BC he returned with an army of mercenaries under a solemn oath to observe the democratic constitution which was then set up .
War with Carthage followed .
In 311 BC Agathocles was besieged and defeated in Syracuse in the battle of Himera .
After defeat in 310 BC he took the desperate resolve of breaking through the blockade and attacking the enemy in Africa .
In Africa he concluded the treaty with Ophellas , ruler of Cyrenaica .
After several victories he was at last completely defeated ( 307 BC ) and fled secretly to Sicily .
A peace treaty with Carthage left him in control of Sicily east of the Halycus River .
Agathocles restored the Syracusan democracy on his death bed and did not want his sons to succeed him as king .
Agathocles was married three times .
His first wife was the widow of his patron Damas by whom he had two sons : Archagathus and Agathocles , whom they were both murdered in 307 BC .
His second wife was Alcia and they had a daughter called Lanassa , who married as the second wife of King Pyrrhus of Epirus .
Theoxena bore Agathocles two children : Archagathus and Theoxena .
He had further descendants from his second and third marriage .
He was described as behaving as a criminal at every stage of his career .
However , he came to " glory " as much as he did brutality by repelling invading Carthaginians and winning the loyalty of the denizens of his land .
Nevertheless , his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite wickednesses do not permit him to be celebrated among the most excellent men . "
Alberta 's economy is the sum of all economic activity in Alberta , Canada 's fourth largest province by population .
Alberta 's per capita GDP in 2007 was by far the highest of any province in Canada at C$ 74,825 ( approx .
In 2006 Alberta 's per capita GDP was higher than all US states , and one of the highest figures in the world .
Alberta 's per capita GDP in 2007 was 61 % higher than the Canadian average of C$ 46,441 and more than twice that of all the Maritime provinces .
In 2006 , the deviation from the national average was the largest for any province in Canadian history .
From these ports to major populations centres and markets in Europe or Asia is several thousands of kilometers .
Agriculture has the been a key industry since the 1870s .
The climate is dry , temperate , and continental , with extreme variations between seasons .
Productive soils are found in most of the southern half of the province ( excluding the mountains ) , and in certain parts of the north .
Agriculture on a large scale is practiced further north in Alberta that anywhere else in North America , extending into the Peace River country above the 55th parallel north .
Generally , however , northern Alberta ( and areas along the Alberta Rockies ) is forested land and logging is more important than agriculture there .
Conventional oil and gas fields are found throughout the province on an axis running from the northwest to the southeast .
Oil sands are found in the northeast , especially around Fort McMurray ( the Athabasca Oil Sands ) .
Because of its ( relatively ) economically isolated location , Alberta relies heavily on transportation links with the rest of the world .
Alberta 's historical development has been largely influenced by the development of new transportation infrastructure , ( see " trends " below ) .
The chernozem ( black soil ) of the parkland region is more agriculturally productive than the red and grey soils to the south .
Urban development has also been most advanced in the parkland belt .
Edmonton and Red Deer are parkland cities , while Calgary is on the parkland-prairie fringe .
Lethbridge and Medicine Hat are prairie cities .
Fort McMurray is the only urbanized population centre in the boreal forest which covers much of the northern half of the province .
Calgary and EdmontonThe Calgary and Edmonton regions , by far the provinces two largest metropolitan regions , account for the majority of the province ’s population .
They are relatively close to each other by the standards of Western Canada and distant from other metropolitan regions such as Vancouver or Winnipeg .
This has produced a history of political and economical rivalry and comparison but also economic integration that has created an urbanized corridor between the two cities .
The economic profile of the two regions is slightly different .
Both cities are mature service economies built on a base of resource extraction in their hinterlands .
However Calgary is predominant in hosting the regional and national headquarters of oil and gas exploration and drilling companies .
Calgary-Edmonton CorridorThe Calgary-Edmonton Corridor is the most urbanized region in the province and one of the densest in Canada .
Measured from north to south , the region covers a distance of roughly .
Calgary – Edmonton rivalry Seeing Calgary and Edmonton are part of a single economic region as the TD study did in 2003 was novel .
The more traditional view had been to see the two cities are economic rivals .
For example , in the 1980 both cities claimed to be the " Oil Capital of Canada " .
Trends Alberta has always been an export-oriented economy .
In line with Harold Innis ' " Staples Thesis " , the economy has changed substantially as different export commodities have risen or fallen in importance .
In sequence , the most important products have been : fur , wheat and beef , and oil and gas .
The development of transportation in Alberta has been crucial to its historical economic development .
Immigration into the province was eased tremendously by the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway 's transcontinental line in 1880s .
Prior to the 1950s , Alberta was a primarily agricultural economy , based on the export of wheat , beef , and a few other commodities .
The health of economy was closely bound up with the price of wheat .
In 1947 a major oil field was discovered near Edmonton .
Since that time , Alberta 's economic fortunes have largely tracked the price of oil , and increasingly natural gas prices .
When oil prices spiked during the 1967 Oil Embargo , 1973 oil crisis , and 1979 energy crisis , Alberta 's economy boomed .
However , during the 1980s oil glut Alberta 's economy suffered .
Alberta boomed once again during the 2003-2008 oil price spike .
In July 2008 the price of oil peaked and began to decline and Alberta 's economy soon followed suit , with unemployment doubling within a year .
By 2012 , despite natural gas prices at a ten-year low and a higher Canadian dollar , oil prices had recovered enough to restart economic growth .
The spin-offs from petroleum have allowed Alberta to develop many other industries .
Oilpatch-related manufacturing is an obvious example , but financial services and government services have also benefited from oil money .
A comparison of the development of Alberta 's less oil and gas-endowed neighbours , Saskatchewan and Manitoba , reveals the role petroleum has played .
Employment Alberta 's economy is a highly developed one in which most people work in services such as healthcare , government , or retail .
Primary industries are also of great importance , however .
Two of the largest producers of petrochemicals in North America are located in central and north central Alberta .
Another factor determining the viability of oil extraction from the Tar Sands is the price of oil .
The oil price increases since 2003 have made it more than profitable to extract this oil , which in the past would give little profit or even a loss .
Energy Oil and gas Since the early 1940s , Alberta had supplied oil and gas to the rest of Canada and the United States .
The Athabasca River region produces oil for internal and external use .
The Athabasca Oil Sands contain the largest proven reserves of oil in the world outside Saudi Arabia .
Alberta also provides 13 % of all the natural gas used in the United States .
Notable gas reserves were discovered in the 1883 near Medicine Hat .
In fact a large glassworks was established at Redcliff .
When Rudyard Kipling visited Medicine Hat he described it as the city " with all hell for a basement " .
Basic statistics Coal Coal has been mined in Alberta since the late 19th century .
Over 1800 mines have operated in Alberta since then .
Alberta is still a major coal producer , every two weeks Alberta produces enough coal to fill the Sky Dome in Toronto .
Much of that coal is burned in Alberta for electricity generation .
Alberta uses over 25 million tonnes of coal annually to generate electricity .
Alberta has vast coal resources and 70 per cent of Canada 's coal reserves are located in Alberta .
This amounts to 33.6 Gigatonnes .
Vast beds of coal are found extending for hundreds of miles , a short distance below the surface of the plains .
The coal belongs to the Cretaceous beds , and while not so heavy as that of the Coal Measures in England is of excellent quality .
In the valley of the Bow River , alongside the Canadian Pacific Railway , valuable beds of anthracite coal are still worked .
The usual coal deposits of the area of bituminous or semi-bituminous coal .
These are largely worked at Lethbridge in southern Alberta and Edmonton in the centre of the province .
Many other parts of the province have pits for private use .
Electricity , Alberta 's generating capacity was 11,919 MW , and Alberta has about of transmission lines .
Alberta has over 490 megawatts of wind power capacity .
Alberta has added 4400 MW of new supply since 1998 – that is equal to all the power generated in Saskatchewan .
Winter peak for power use in one day was in November 2006 – 9,661 MW .
Summer peak for power use in one day was set on July 18 , 2007 – 9,192 MW .
Mineral mining Building stones mined in Alberta include Rundle stone , and Paskapoo sandstone .
Diamonds were first found in Alberta in 1958 , and many stones have been found since , although to date no large-scale mines have been developed .
ManufacturingThe Edmonton area , and in particular Nisku is a major centre for manufacturing oil and gas related equipment .
As well Edmonton 's Refinery Row is home to a petrochemical industry .
BiotechnologySeveral companies and services in the biotech sector are clustered around the University of Alberta , for example ColdFX .
Transportation Edmonton is a major distribution centre for northern communities , hence the nickname " Gateway to the North " .
Edmonton is one CN Rail 's most important hubs .
Since 1996 , Canadian Pacific Railway has its headquarters in downtown Calgary .
WestJet , Canada 's second largest air carrier , is headquartered in Calgary , by Calgary International Airport , which serves as the airline 's primary hub .
Prior to its dissolution , Canadian Airlines was headquartered in Calgary by the airport .
Prior to its dissolution , Air Canada subsidiary Zip was headquartered in Calgary .
Agriculture and forestry Agriculture In the past , cattle , horses , and sheep were reared in the southern prairie region on ranches or smaller holdings .
Currently Alberta produces cattle valued at over $ 3.3 billion , as well as other livestock in lesser quantities .
In this region irrigation is widely used .
In 2011 , Alberta producers seeded an estimated total of to spring wheat , durum , barley , oats , mixed grains , triticale , canola and dry peas .
Of the total seeded area , 94 per cent was harvested as grains and oilseeds and six per cent as greenfeed and silage .
Over three million cattle are residents of the province at one time or another , and Albertan beef has a healthy worldwide market .
Alberta is one of the prime producers of plains buffalo ( bison ) for the consumer market .
Sheep for wool and lamb are also raised .
Across the province , the once common grain elevator is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreased and farmers now truck the grain to central points .
In 1999 , lumber products from Alberta were valued at $ 4.1 billion of which 72 % were exported around the world .
Since forests cover approximately 59 % of the province 's land area , the government allows about to be harvested annually from the forests on public lands .
Services Despite the high profile of the extractive industries , Alberta has a mature economy and most people work in services .
FinanceCalgary is head office for many major oil and gas related companies , and many financial service business have grown up around them .
Baron Augustin-Louis Cauchy ( ; 21 August 1789 – 23 May 1857 ) was a French mathematician who was an early pioneer of analysis .
He defined continuity in terms of infinitesimal s and gave several important theorems in complex analysis and initiated the study of permutation group s in abstract algebra .
A profound mathematician , Cauchy exercised a great influence over his contemporaries and successors .
His writings cover the entire range of mathematics and mathematical physics . "
More concepts and theorems have been named for Cauchy than for any other mathematician ( in elasticity alone there are sixteen concepts and theorems named for Cauchy ) . "
Cauchy was a prolific writer ; he wrote approximately eight hundred research articles and five complete textbooks .
He was a devout Roman Catholic , strict Bourbon royalist , and a close associate of the Jesuit order .
Biography Youth and education Cauchy was the son of Louis François Cauchy ( 1760 – 1848 ) and Marie-Madeleine Desestre .
Cauchy married Aloise de Bure in 1818 .
She was a close relative of the publisher who published most of Cauchy 's works .
By her he had two daughters , Marie Françoise Alicia ( 1819 ) and Marie Mathilde ( 1823 ) .
Cauchy 's father ( Louis François Cauchy ) was a high official in the Parisian Police of the New Régime .
He lost his position because of the French Revolution ( July 14 , 1789 ) that broke out one month before Augustin-Louis was born .
After the execution of Robespierre ( 1794 ) , it was safe for the family to return to Paris .
There Louis-François Cauchy found himself a new bureaucratic job , and quickly moved up the ranks .
The famous mathematician Lagrange was also no stranger in the Cauchy family .
Most of the curriculum consisted of classical languages ; the young and ambitious Cauchy , being a brilliant student , won many prizes in Latin and Humanities .
In spite of these successes , Augustin-Louis chose an engineering career , and prepared himself for the entrance examination to the École Polytechnique .
In 1805 he placed second out of 293 applicants on this exam , and he was admitted .
One of the main purposes of this school was to give future civil and military engineers a high-level scientific and mathematical education .
The school functioned under military discipline , which caused the young and pious Cauchy some problems in adapting .
He graduated in civil engineering , with the highest honors .
Engineering days After finishing school in 1810 , Cauchy accepted a job as a junior engineer in Cherbourg , where Napoleon intended to build a naval base .
Cauchy 's first two manuscripts ( on polyhedra ) were accepted ; the third one ( on directrices of conic sections ) was rejected .
In September 1812 , now 23 years old , after becoming ill from overwork , Cauchy returned to Paris .
Although he formally kept his engineering position , he was transferred from the payroll of the Ministry of the Marine to the Ministry of the Interior .
He attempted admission to the First Class of the Institut de France but failed on three different occasions between 1813 and 1815 .
In 1815 Napoleon was defeated at Waterloo , and the newly installed Bourbon king Louis XVIII took the restoration in hand .
Cauchy was by then a rising mathematical star , who certainly merited a professorship .
One of his great successes at that time was the proof of Fermat 's polygonal number theorem .
However , the fact that Cauchy was known to be very loyal to the Bourbons , doubtless also helped him in becoming the successor of Poinsot .
He finally quit his engineering job , and received a one-year contract for teaching mathematics to second-year students of the École Polytechnique .
In 1816 , this Bonapartist , non-religious school was reorganized , and several liberal professors were fired ; the reactionary Cauchy was promoted to full professor .
When Cauchy was 28 years old , he was still living with his parents .
His father found it high time for his son to marry ; he found him a suitable bride , Aloïse de Bure , five years his junior .
The de Bure family were printers and booksellers , and published most of Cauchy 's works .
Aloïse and Augustin were married on April 4 , 1818 , with great Roman Catholic pomp and ceremony , in the Church of Saint-Sulpice .
In 1819 the couple 's first daughter , Marie Françoise Alicia , was born , and in 1823 the second and last daughter , Marie Mathilde .
The conservative political climate that lasted until 1830 suited Cauchy perfectly .
In 1824 Louis XVIII died , and was succeeded by his even more reactionary brother Charles X .
During these years Cauchy was highly productive , and published one important mathematical treatise after another .
He received cross appointments at the Collège de France , and the Faculté des Sciences of the University .
In exile In July 1830 France underwent another revolution .
Charles X fled the country , and was succeeded by the non-Bourbon king Louis-Philippe ( of the House of Orléans ) .
Riots , in which uniformed students of the École Polytechnique took an active part , raged close to Cauchy 's home in Paris .
These events marked a turning point in Cauchy 's life , and a break in his mathematical productivity .
He spent a short time at Fribourg in Switzerland , where he had to decide whether he would swear a required oath of allegiance to the new regime .
He refused to do this , and consequently lost all his positions in Paris , except his membership of the Academy , for which an oath was not required .
He taught in Turin during 1832-1833 .
In 1831 , he had been elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences .
The young Duke had neither taste nor talent for either mathematics or science , so student and teacher were a perfect mismatch .
Although Cauchy took his mission very seriously , he did this with great clumsiness , and with surprising lack of authority over the Duke .
His role as tutor lasted until the Duke became eighteen years old , in September 1838 .
Cauchy did hardly any research during those five years , while the Duke acquired a lifelong dislike of mathematics .
The only good that came out of this episode was Cauchy 's promotion to Baron , a title that Cauchy set great store by .
In 1834 , his wife and two daughters moved to Prague , and Cauchy was finally reunited with his family , after four years of exile .
Last years Cauchy returned to Paris and his position at the Academy of Sciences late in 1838 .
He could not regain his teaching positions , because he still refused to swear an oath of allegiance .
However , he desperately wanted to regain a formal position in Parisian science .
In August 1839 a vacancy appeared in the Bureau des Longitudes .
This Bureau had some resemblance to the Academy ; for instance , it had the right to co-opt its members .
Since it was thought that position on sea was best determined by astronomical observations , the Bureau had developed into an organization resembling an academy of astronomical sciences .
In November 1839 Cauchy was elected to the Bureau , and discovered immediately that the matter of the oath was not so easily dispensed with .
Without his oath , the king refused to approve his election .
Still Cauchy refused to take any oaths ; however , he did feel loyal enough to direct his research to celestial mechanics .
In 1840 , he presented a dozen papers on this topic to the Academy .
He also described and illustrated the signed-digit representation of numbers , an innovation presented in England in 1727 by John Colson .
The confounded membership of the Bureau lasted until the end of 1843 , when Cauchy was finally replaced by Poinsot .
All through the nineteenth century the French educational system struggled with the separation of Church and State .
The Catholic Church strived for freedom of education ; the Church found in Cauchy a staunch and illustrious ally in this struggle .
He lent his prestige and knowledge to the École Normale Écclésiastique , a school in Paris run by Jesuits , for training teachers for their colleges .
He also took part in the founding of the Institut Catholique .
The purpose of this institute was to counter the effects of the absence of Catholic university education in France .
These activities did not make Cauchy popular with his colleagues who , on the whole , supported the Enlightenment ideals of the French Revolution .
When a chair of mathematics became vacant at the Collège de France in 1843 , Cauchy applied for it , but got just three out of 45 votes .
The year 1848 was the year of revolution all over Europe ; revolutions broke out in numerous countries , beginning in France .
King Louis-Philippe , fearful of sharing the fate of Louis XVI , fled to England .
The oath of allegiance was abolished , and the road to an academic appointment was finally clear for Cauchy .
On March 1 , 1849 , he was reinstated at the Faculté de Sciences , as a professor of mathematical astronomy .
Soon ( early 1852 ) the President became the Emperor of France , and took the name Napoleon III .
Not unexpectedly , the idea came up in bureaucratic circles that it would be useful to require a loyalty oath from all state functionaries , including university professors .
Not always does history repeat itself , however , because this time a cabinet minister was able to convince the Emperor to exempt Cauchy from the oath .
Cauchy remained a professor at the University until his death at the age of 67 .
He received the Last Rites and died at 4 a.m. during the night of May 23 , 1857 .
More important is his memoir on wave propagation , which obtained the Grand Prix of the French Academy of Sciences in 1816 .
Cauchy 's writings covered notable topics including : the theory of series , where he developed the notion of convergence and discovered many of the basic formulas for q-series .
The theory of numbers and complex quantities ; he was the first to define complex numbers as pairs of real numbers .
The theory of groups and substitutions ; and the theory of functions , differential equations , and determinants .
Wave theory , mechanics , elasticity In the theory of light he worked on Fresnel 's wave theory and on the dispersion and polarization of light .
He also contributed significant research in mechanics , substituting the notion of the continuity of geometrical displacements for the principle of the continuity of matter .
He wrote on the equilibrium of rods and elastic membranes and on waves in elastic media .
He introduced a 3 × 3 symmetric matrix of numbers that is now known as the Cauchy stress tensor .
In elasticity , he originated the theory of stress , and his results are nearly as valuable as those of Simeon Poisson .
Other significant contributions include being the first to prove the Fermat polygonal number theorem .
Complex functions Cauchy is most famous for his single-handed development of complex function theory .
In full form the theorem was given in 1825 .
The 1825 paper is seen by many as Cauchy 's most important contribution to mathematics .
In 1826 Cauchy gave a formal definition of a residue of a function .
This concept regards functions that have pole s — isolated singularities , i.e. , points where a function goes to positive or negative infinity .
In 1831 , while in Turin , Cauchy submitted two papers to the Academy of Sciences of Turin .
The contour integral is taken counter-clockwise .
For quite some time , contemporaries of Cauchy ignored his theory , believing it to be too complicated .
Cours d'Analyse In addition to his work on complex functions , Cauchy was the first to stress the importance of rigor in analysis .
His book Cours d'Analyse had a such an impact that Judith Grabiner writes Cauchy was " the man who taught rigorous analysis to all of Europe . "
This book is frequently noted as being the first place that inequalities , and \ delta - \ epsilon arguments were introduced into Calculus .
M. Barany claims that the École mandated the inclusion of infinitesimal methods against Cauchy 's better judgement .
Gilain argued that the infinitesimal portions of the book were likely a late insertion .
Cauchy gave an explicit definition of an infinitesimal in terms of a sequence tending to zero .
Namely , such a null sequence " becomes " an infinitesimal in Cauchy 's and Lazare Carnot 's terminology .
Sources disagree if Cauchy defined his notion of infinitesimal in terms of limits .
Some have argued that such a claim is ambiguous , and essentially a play of words on the term " limit " .
Barany recently argued that Cauchy possessed a kinetic notion of limit similar to Newton 's .
Taylor 's theorem He was the first to prove Taylor 's theorem rigorously , establishing his well-known form of the remainder .
In this book he gave the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a limit in the form that is still taught .
Also Cauchy 's well-known test for absolute convergence stems from this book : Cauchy condensation test .
In 1829 he defined for the first time a complex function of a complex variable in another textbook .
Thus Cauchy 's work has a strong impact on both pure mathematics and practical engineering .
Output Cauchy was very productive , in number of papers second only to Leonhard Euler .
This made his father flee with the family to Arcueil during the French Revolution .
Their life there was apparently hard ; Augustin-Louis 's father , Louis François , spoke of living on rice , bread , and crackers during the period .
He also had links to the Society of Jesus and defended them at the Academy when it was politically unwise to do so .
His zeal for his faith may have led to his caring for Charles Hermite during his illness and leading Hermite to become a faithful Catholic .
It also inspired Cauchy to plead on behalf of the Irish during the Potato Famine .
His royalism and religious zeal also made him contentious , which caused difficulties with his colleagues .
When Libri was accused of stealing books he was replaced by Joseph Liouville which caused a rift between him and Cauchy .
Another dispute concerned Jean Marie Constant Duhamel and a claim on inelastic shocks .
Cauchy was later shown , by Jean-Victor Poncelet , that he was in the wrong .
Archimedes of Syracuse ( ; BC – BC ) was a Greek mathematician , physicist , engineer , inventor , and astronomer .
Although few details of his life are known , he is regarded as one of the leading scientist s in classical antiquity .
Among his advances in physics are the foundations of hydrostatics , statics and an explanation of the principle of the lever .
He is credited with designing innovative machine s , including siege engine s and the screw pump that bears his name .
Modern experiments have tested claims that Archimedes designed machines capable of lifting attacking ships out of the water and setting ships on fire using an array of mirrors .
Archimedes is generally considered to be the greatest mathematician of antiquity and one of the greatest of all time .
He also defined the spiral bearing his name , formulae for the volume s of surfaces of revolution and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers .
Archimedes died during the Siege of Syracuse when he was killed by a Roman soldier despite orders that he should not be harmed .
Cicero describes visiting the tomb of Archimedes , which was surmounted by a sphere inscribe d within a cylinder .
Unlike his inventions , the mathematical writings of Archimedes were little known in antiquity .
Biography Archimedes was born c. 287 BC in the seaport city of Syracuse , Sicily , at that time a self-governing colony in Magna Graecia .
The date of birth is based on a statement by the Byzantine Greek historian John Tzetzes that Archimedes lived for 75 years .
In The Sand Reckoner , Archimedes gives his father 's name as Phidias , an astronomer about whom nothing is known .
Plutarch wrote in his Parallel Lives that Archimedes was related to King Hiero II , the ruler of Syracuse .
A biography of Archimedes was written by his friend Heracleides but this work has been lost , leaving the details of his life obscure .
It is unknown , for instance , whether he ever married or had children .
During his youth , Archimedes may have studied in Alexandria , Egypt , where Conon of Samos and Eratosthenes of Cyrene were contemporaries .
Archimedes died c. 212 BC during the Second Punic War , when Roman forces under General Marcus Claudius Marcellus captured the city of Syracuse after a two-year-long siege .
According to the popular account given by Plutarch , Archimedes was contemplating a mathematical diagram when the city was captured .
A Roman soldier commanded him to come and meet General Marcellus but he declined , saying that he had to finish working on the problem .
The soldier was enraged by this , and killed Archimedes with his sword .
Plutarch also gives a account of the death of Archimedes which suggests that he may have been killed while attempting to surrender to a Roman soldier .
According to this story , Archimedes was carrying mathematical instruments , and was killed because the soldier thought that they were valuable items .
General Marcellus was reportedly angered by the death of Archimedes , as he considered him a valuable scientific asset and had ordered that he not be harmed .
The tomb of Archimedes carried a sculpture illustrating his favorite mathematical proof , consisting of a sphere and a cylinder of the same height and diameter .
Archimedes had proven that the volume and surface area of the sphere are two thirds that of the cylinder including its bases .
In 75 BC , 137 years after his death , the Roman orator Cicero was serving as quaestor in Sicily .
He had heard stories about the tomb of Archimedes , but none of the locals was able to give him the location .
Eventually he found the tomb near the Agrigentine gate in Syracuse , in a neglected condition and overgrown with bushes .
Cicero had the tomb cleaned up , and was able to see the carving and read some of the verses that had been added as an inscription .
A tomb discovered in a hotel courtyard in Syracuse in the early 1960s was claimed to be that of Archimedes , but its location today is unknown .
The standard versions of the life of Archimedes were written long after his death by the historians of Ancient Rome .
It sheds little light on Archimedes as a person , and focuses on the war machines that he is said to have built in order to defend the city .
Archimedes had to solve the problem without damaging the crown , so he could not melt it down into a regularly shaped body in order to calculate its density .
For practical purposes water is incompressible , so the submerged crown would displace an amount of water equal to its own volume .
By dividing the mass of the crown by the volume of water displaced , the density of the crown could be obtained .
This density would be lower than that of gold if cheaper and less dense metals had been added .
Archimedes then took to the streets naked , so excited by his discovery that he had forgotten to dress , crying " Eureka ! "
, " meaning " I have found it ! " ) .
The test was conducted successfully , proving that silver had indeed been mixed in .
The story of the golden crown does not appear in the known works of Archimedes .
Archimedes may have instead sought a solution that applied the principle known in hydrostatics as Archimedes ' principle , which he describes in his treatise On Floating Bodies .
This principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces .
The difference in density between the two samples would cause the scale to tip accordingly .
Archimedes ' screw A large part of Archimedes ' work in engineering arose from fulfilling the needs of his home city of Syracuse .
The Syracusia is said to have been the largest ship built in classical antiquity .
According to Athenaeus , it was capable of carrying 600 people and included garden decorations , a gymnasium and a temple dedicated to the goddess Aphrodite among its facilities .
Archimedes ' machine was a device with a revolving screw-shaped blade inside a cylinder .
It was turned by hand , and could also be used to transfer water from a body of water into irrigation canals .
The Archimedes screw is still in use today for pumping liquids and granulated solids such as coal and grain .
The Archimedes screw described in Roman times by Vitruvius may have been an improvement on a screw pump that was used to irrigate the Hanging Gardens of Babylon .
Claw of Archimedes The Claw of Archimedes is a weapon that he is said to have designed in order to defend the city of Syracuse .
Also known as " the ship shaker , " the claw consisted of a crane-like arm from which a large metal grappling hook was suspended .
When the claw was dropped onto an attacking ship the arm would swing upwards , lifting the ship out of the water and possibly sinking it .
Heat ray The 2nd century AD author Lucian wrote that during the Siege of Syracuse ( c. 214 – 212 BC ) , Archimedes destroyed enemy ships with fire .
Centuries later , Anthemius of Tralles mentions burning-glass es as Archimedes ' weapon .
The device , sometimes called the " Archimedes heat ray " , was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships , causing them to catch fire .
This purported weapon has been the subject of ongoing debate about its credibility since the Renaissance .
René Descartes rejected it as false , while modern researchers have attempted to recreate the effect using only the means that would have been available to Archimedes .
It has been suggested that a large array of highly polished bronze or copper shields acting as mirrors could have been employed to focus sunlight onto a ship .
This would have used the principle of the parabolic reflector in a manner similar to a solar furnace .
A test of the Archimedes heat ray was carried out in 1973 by the Greek scientist Ioannis Sakkas .
The experiment took place at the Skaramagas naval base outside Athens .
On this occasion 70 mirrors were used , each with a copper coating and a size of around five by three feet ( 1.5 by 1 m ) .
The mirrors were pointed at a plywood of a Roman warship at a distance of around 160 feet ( 50 m ) .
When the mirrors were focused accurately , the ship burst into flames within a few seconds .
The plywood ship had a coating of tar paint , which may have aided combustion .
A coating of tar would have been commonplace on ships in the classical era .
Flames broke out on a patch of the ship , but only after the sky had been cloudless and the ship had remained stationary for around ten minutes .
It was concluded that the device was a feasible weapon under these conditions .
The MIT group repeated the experiment for the television show MythBusters , using a wooden fishing boat in San Francisco as the target .
Again some charring occurred , along with a small amount of flame .
In order to catch fire , wood needs to reach its autoignition temperature , which is around 300 ° C ( 570 ° F ) .
In December 2010 , MythBusters again looked at the heat ray story in a special edition featuring Barack Obama , entitled President 's Challenge .
The show concluded that a more likely effect of the mirrors would have been blinding , dazzling , or distracting the crew of the ship .
Other discoveries and inventions While Archimedes did not invent the lever , he gave an explanation of the principle involved in his work On the Equilibrium of Planes .
Earlier descriptions of the lever are found in the Peripatetic school of the followers of Aristotle , and are sometimes attributed to Archytas .
Archimedes has also been credited with improving the power and accuracy of the catapult , and with inventing the odometer during the First Punic War .
The odometer was described as a cart with a gear mechanism that dropped a ball into a container after each mile traveled .
Cicero ( 106 – 43 BC ) mentions Archimedes briefly in his dialogue De re publica , which portrays a fictional conversation taking place in 129 BC .
Cicero mentions similar mechanisms designed by Thales of Miletus and Eudoxus of Cnidus .
The dialogue says that Marcellus kept one of the devices as his only personal loot from Syracuse , and donated the other to the Temple of Virtue in Rome .
Pappus of Alexandria stated that Archimedes had written a manuscript ( now lost ) on the construction of these mechanisms entitled .
Modern research in this area has been focused on the Antikythera mechanism , another device from classical antiquity that was probably designed for the same purpose .
Constructing mechanisms of this kind would have required a sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing .
Mathematics While he is often regarded as a designer of mechanical devices , Archimedes also made contributions to the field of mathematics .
Plutarch wrote : " He placed his whole affection and ambition in those purer speculations where there can be no reference to the vulgar needs of life . "
Archimedes was able to use infinitesimal s in a way that is similar to modern integral calculus .
This technique is known as the method of exhaustion , and he employed it to approximate the value of π .
As the number of sides increases , it becomes a more accurate approximation of a circle .
He also proved that the area of a circle was equal to π multiplied by the square of the radius of the circle ( πr2 ) .
In On the Sphere and Cylinder , Archimedes postulates that any magnitude when added to itself enough times will exceed any given magnitude .
This is the Archimedean property of real numbers .
In Measurement of a Circle , Archimedes gives the value of the square root of 3 as lying between ( approximately 1.7320261 ) and ( approximately 1.7320512 ) .
The actual value is approximately 1.7320508 , making this a very accurate estimate .
He introduced this result without offering any explanation of how he had obtained it .
It is possible that he used an iterative procedure to calculate these values .
This proof uses a variation of the series which sums to .
In The Sand Reckoner , Archimedes set out to calculate the number of grains of sand that the universe could contain .
In doing so , he challenged the notion that the number of grains of sand was too large to be counted .
To solve the problem , Archimedes devised a system of counting based on the myriad .
The word is from the Greek murias , for the number 10,000 .
Writings The works of Archimedes were written in Doric Greek , the dialect of ancient Syracuse .
Pappus of Alexandria mentions On Sphere-Making and another work on polyhedra , while Theon of Alexandria quotes a remark about refraction from the Catoptrica .
During his lifetime , Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in Alexandria .
During the Renaissance , the Editio Princeps ( First Edition ) was published in Basel in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin .
Around the year 1586 Galileo Galilei invented a hydrostatic balance for weighing metals in air and water after apparently being inspired by the work of Archimedes .
Surviving works Apocryphal works Archimedes ' Book of Lemmas or Liber Assumptorum is a treatise with fifteen propositions on the nature of circles .
The earliest known copy of the text is in Arabic .
The Lemmas may be based on an earlier work by Archimedes that is now lost .
It has also been claimed that Heron 's formula for calculating the area of a triangle from the length of its sides was known to Archimedes .
However , the first reliable reference to the formula is given by Heron of Alexandria in the 1st century AD .
Archimedes Palimpsest The foremost document containing the work of Archimedes is the Archimedes Palimpsest .
In 1906 , the Danish professor Johan Ludvig Heiberg visited Constantinople and examined a 174-page goatskin parchment of prayers written in the 13th century AD .
He discovered that it was a palimpsest , a document with text that had been written over an erased older work .
Palimpsests were created by scraping the ink from existing works and reusing them , which was a common practice in the Middle Ages as vellum was expensive .
The older works in the palimpsest were identified by scholars as 10th century AD copies of previously unknown treatises by Archimedes .
The parchment spent hundreds of years in a monastery library in Constantinople before being sold to a private collector in the 1920s .
On October 29 , 1998 it was sold at auction to an anonymous buyer for $ 2 million at Christie 's in New York .
The palimpsest holds seven treatises , including the only surviving copy of On Floating Bodies in the original Greek .
It is the only known source of The Method of Mechanical Theorems , referred to by Suidas and thought to have been lost forever .
Stomachion was also discovered in the palimpsest , with a more complete analysis of the puzzle than had been found in previous texts .
Conon of Samos lived , suggesting that Archimedes may have been an older man when writing some of his works .
d. " It was usual to smear the seams or even the whole hull with pitch or with pitch and wax " .

Complementary medicine is alternative medicine used together with conventional medical treatment in a belief , not proven by using scientific methods , that it " complements " the treatment .
CAM is the abbreviation for Complementary and alternative medicine .
Integrative medicine ( or integrative health ) is the combination of the practices and methods of alternative medicine with evidence-based medicine .
The term alternative medicine is used in information issued by public bodies in the United States of America and the United Kingdom .
Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine and health care provider s varies from country to country , and state to state .
Background Terms and definitions There is no coherent , consistent and widely accepted definition of alternative medicine .
Healthcare practices categorized as alternative may differ in their historical origin , theoretical basis , diagnostic technique , therapeutic practice and in their relationship to the medical mainstream .
Thus , chiropractic is not considered alternative in Denmark and likewise osteopathy in the US is no longer thought of as an alternative therapy .
One common feature of all definitions of alternative medicine is its designation as " other than " conventional medicine .
Some definitions seek to specify alternative medicine in terms of its social and political marginality to mainstream healthcare .
In 1999 , 7.7 % of US hospitals reported using some form of CAM therapy ; this proportion had risen to 37.7 % by 2008 .
The 1995 OAM conference definition , an expansion of Eisenberg 's 1993 formulation , is silent regarding questions of the medical effectiveness of alternative therapies .
There can not be two kinds of medicine – conventional and alternative .
There is only medicine that has been adequately tested and medicine that has not , medicine that works and medicine that may or may not work .
Once a treatment has been tested rigorously , it no longer matters whether it was considered alternative at the outset .
If it is found to be reasonably safe and effective , it will be accepted .
But assertions , speculation , and testimonials do not substitute for evidence .
Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments .
Complementary medicine " refers to use of alternative medicine alongside conventional science based medicine , in the belief that it increases the effectiveness .
While some herbal therapies are mainstream in Europe , but are alternative in the United States .
Since that time , those who have analyzed this trend have deliberated over the most apt language with which to describe this emergent health field .
Its use can also be misleading as it may erroneously imply that a real medical alternative exists .
From a historical perspective , the emergence of alternative medicine , if not the term itself , is typically dated to the 19th century .
An early instance of the influence of the Flexner Report outside North America is Peking Union Medical College .
Among putative medical practices available at the time which later became known as " alternative medicine " were homeopathy ( founded in Germany in the early 19c . )
and chiropractic ( founded in North America in the late 19c . ) .
A distinction was being made between western scientific medicine and indigenous systems .
An example is given by an official report about indigenous systems of medicine in India , including Ayurveda , submitted by Mohammad Usman of Madras and others in 1923 .
This stated that the first question the Committee considered was " to decide whether the indigenous systems of medicine were scientific or not " .
He asked ' Can there be any reasonable " alternative " ? '
However , despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine , most of the early alternative/complementary medical centers failed .
Medical schools ' teaching includes such topics as doctor-patient communication , ethics , the art of medicine , and engaging in complex clinical reasoning ( medical decision-making ) .
Medical schools are responsible for conferring medical degrees , but a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority .
Licensed physicians in the United States who have attended one of the established medical schools there have usually graduated Doctor of Medicine ( MD ) .
All states require that applicants for MD licensure be graduates of an approved medical school and complete the United States Medical Licensing Exam ( USMLE ) .
By 2000 some medical schools in the United Kingdom were offering CAM familiarisation courses to undergraduate medical students while some were also offering modules specifically on CAM .
African , Caribbean , Pacific Island , Native American , and other regional cultures have traditional medical systems as diverse as their diversity of cultures .
Examples and classes Alternative medicines include a wide range of treatments and practices .
The following examples include some of the more common methods in use .
Alternative medical systems are complete health systems with their own approaches to diagnosis and treatment that differ from the conventional biomedical approach to health .
Some are cultural systems such as Ayurveda and Traditional Chinese Medicine , while others , such as Homeopathy and Naturopathy are relatively recent and were developed in the West .
Ayurvedic medicine Ayurvedic medicine is a traditional medicine of India and has strong links with Buddhism and Hinduism .
It is based on the belief that health is controlled by 3 " humours " with disease caused by an imbalance of these " humours " .
The basis of treatment has some similarities with " Western medicine " .
Remedies are mainly plant based with some use of animal materials .
Other concerns include the use of herbs containing toxic compounds and the lack of quality control in Ayurvedic facilities .
Homeopathy Homeopathy is based on the belief that a disease can be cured by a very low dose of substance that creates similar symptoms in a healthy person .
Naturopathy favors a holistic approach with non-invasive treatment and , similar to conventional medicine , encourages minimal use of surgery and drugs .
The term " naturopathy " is derived from Greek and Latin , and literally translates as " nature disease " .
Modern naturopathy grew out of the Natural Cure movement of Europe .
The term was coined in 1895 by John Scheel and popularized by Benedict Lust , the " father of U.S. naturopathy " .
Beginning in the 1970s , there was a revival of interest in the United States and Canada in conjunction with the holistic health movement .
Today , naturopathy is primarily practiced in the United States and Canada .
The scope of practice varies widely between jurisdictions , and naturopaths in unregulated jurisdictions may use the Naturopathic Doctor designation or other titles regardless of level of education .
Energy therapies Energy therapies are designed to influence energy fields ( biofields ) that practitioners believe surround and enter the body .
Some energy therapies involve the use of crystals , while others use magnets and electric fields .
Biofields Biofield therapies are intended to influence energy fields that , it is purported , surround and penetrate the body .
Acupuncture is a component of Traditional Chinese Medicine .
It is believed that insertion of needles at various parts of the body determined by astrological calculations can restore balance to the blocked flows , and thereby cure disease .
Chiropractic was developed in the belief that manipulating the spine affects the flow of a supernatural vital energy and thereby affects health and disease .
Electromagnetic fields Bioelectromagnetic - based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields , such as pulsed fields , alternating-current , or direct-current fields in an unconventional manner .
Magnetic healing does not claim existence of supernatural energies , but asserts that magnets can be used to defy the laws of physics to influence health and disease .
Mind body therapies Mind – body therapies attempt to use the mind to affect bodily symptoms and functions ; examples include yoga , spirituality and relaxation .
Mind-body medicine takes a holistic approach to health that explores the interconnection between the mind , body and spirit .
It works under the premise that the mind can affect " bodily functions and symptoms " .
Mind body medicine includes healing claims made in yoga , meditation , deep-breathing exercises , guided imagery , hypnotherapy , progressive relaxation , qi gong and tai chi .
Religion based healing practices , such as use of prayer and the laying of hands in Christian faith healing , rely on belief in divine intervention for healing .
Herbs , diet and vitamins Biological approaches include the use of herbal medicines , special diets or very high doses of vitamins .
Herbal " remedies in this case , may include use of nonherbal toxic chemicals from nonbiological sources , such as use of the poison lead in Traditional Chinese Medicine .
Body manipulation Body-based therapies such as massage , chiropractic and osteopathy use movement and physical manipulation of joints and muscles .
Manipulative and body-based practices feature manipulation or movement of body parts , such as is done in chiropractic manipulation .
Criticism CAM , and use of the term " alternative medicine " , have been criticised .
- Arnold Relman , editor in chief emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine .
Another , Marcia Angell , argued that it was " a new name for snake oil . "
It was thus possible for a method to change categories ( proven vs. unproven ) , based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof .
Prominent supporters of this position include George D. Lundberg , former editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association ( JAMA ) .
He has also stated that " there is no alternative medicine .
There is only medicine that works and medicine that does n't work . "
He has argued that , if a technique is demonstrated effective in properly performed trials , it ceases to be alternative and simply becomes medicine .
( This was supported by the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) . )
They argued that the vast majority of studies were based on fundamental misunderstandings of physiology and disease , and have shown little or no effect .
Stephen Barrett , founder and operator of Quackwatch , has argued that practices labeled " alternative " should be reclassified as either genuine , experimental , or questionable .
Sampson has also pointed out that CAM tolerated contradiction without thorough reason and experiment .
Despite this , the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine budget has been on a sharp sustained rise to support complementary medicine .
There have been negative results in almost all studies conducted over ten years at a cost of $ 2.5 billion by the NCCAM .
There are concerns that just having NIH support is being used to give unfounded " legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate . "
So far , alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone .
It is time to change this . "
In general , he believes that CAM can and should be subjected to scientific testing .
Another critic has argued that academic proponents of integrative medicine sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments in order to achieve a placebo effect .
However , a 2010 survey of family physicians found that 56 % of respondents said they had used a placebo in clinical practice as well .
Eighty-five percent of respondents believed placebos can have both psychological and physical benefits .
Integrative medicine has been criticized in that its practitioners , trained in science based medicine , deliberately mislead patients by pretending placebo s are not . "
Quackademic medicine " is a pejorative term used for “ integrative medicine ” , which is considered to be an infiltration of quackery into academic science-based medicine .
CAM includes all such practices and ideas self-defined by their users as preventing or treating illness or promoting health and well-being .
About 50 % of people in developed countries use some kind of complementary and alternative medicine other than prayer for health .
About 40 % of cancer patients use some form of CAM .
Americans spend many billions on the therapies annually .
Most Americans used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain .
In America , women were more likely than men to use CAM , with the biggest difference in use of mind-body therapies including prayer specifically for health reasons " .
In 2008 , more than 37 % of American hospitals offered alternative therapies , up from 26.5 percent in 2005 , and 25 % in 2004 .
More than 70 % of the hospitals offering CAM were in urban areas .
A survey of Americans found that 88 percent agreed that " there are some good ways of treating sickness that medical science does not recognize " .
In 2002 , at least 60 percent of US medical schools have at least some class time spent teaching alternative therapies . "
In Germany herbs are tightly regulated : half are prescribed by doctors and covered by health insurance .
In developing nations , access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and poverty .
Traditional remedies , often closely resembling or forming the basis for alternative remedies , may comprise primary healthcare or be integrated into the healthcare system .
A 1997 survey found that 13.7 % of respondents in the United States had sought the services of both a medical doctor and an alternative medicine practitioner .
Medical doctors are often unaware of their patient 's use of alternative medical treatments as only 38.5 % of the patients alternative therapies were discussed with their medical doctor .
Palliative careComplementary therapies are often used in palliative care or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients .
Complementary medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine . "
If the patient desired complementary therapies , and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient , they were considered acceptable . "
The non-pharmacologic interventions of complementary medicine can employ mind-body interventions designed to " reduce pain and concomitant mood disturbance and increase quality of life . "
In contrast , other approaches may be partially recognized and others have no regulation at all .
Regulation and licensing of alternative medicine ranges widely from country to country , and state to state .
Government bodies in the USA and elsewhere have published information or guidance about alternative medicine .
One of those is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) , which mentions specifically homeopathic products , traditional Chinese medicine and Ayurvedic products .
Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial , since research on them is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed .
Edzard Ernst , a former professor of complementary medicine , characterized the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak , nonexistent , or negative .
According to a 2005 book by a US Institute of Medicine panel , the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically .
As of 2005 , the Cochrane Library had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews .
An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers .
In 83 % of the cases , the readers agreed .
In the 17 % in which they disagreed , a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating .
However , the CAM review used the more developed 2004 Cochrane database , while the conventional review used the initial 1998 Cochrane database .
Most alternative medical treatments are not patent able , which may lead to less research funding from the private sector .
Some have proposed adopting a prize system to reward medical research .
However , public funding for research exists .
Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine .
Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results .
Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers has stated : Safety Adequacy of regulation and CAM safety Many of the claims regarding the safety and efficacy of alternative medicine are controversial .
Some alternative treatments have been associated with unexpected side effects , which can be fatal .
One of the commonly voiced concerns about complementary alternative medicine ( CAM ) is the manner in which is regulated .
There is no general consensus about how to balance consumer protection ( from false claims , toxicity , and advertising ) with freedom to choose remedies .
Some contend that alternative medicines should not require any more regulation than over-the-counter medicines that can also be toxic in overdose ( such as paracetamol ) .
Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine .
Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy , shark cartilage , bioresonance therapy , oxygen and ozone therapies , insulin potentiation therapy .
Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs , radiation therapy , or anesthetics during surgery , among other problems .
Any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects .
An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is Homeopathy .
Since 1938 , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has regulated homeopathic products in " several significantly different ways from other drugs . "
For this reason , critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous .
In short , even innocuous treatments can indirectly produce negative outcomes .
Between 2001 and 2003 , four children died in Australia because their parents chose ineffective naturopathic , homeopathic , or other alternative medicines and diets rather than conventional therapies .
In all , they found 17 instances in which children were significantly harmed by a failure to use conventional medicine .
However , many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials , and they have been shown to be ineffective .
Research funding Although the Dutch government funded CAM research between 1986 and 2003 , it formally ended funding in 2006 .
Appeal A study published in 1998 indicates that a majority of alternative medicine use was in conjunction with standard medical treatments .
Approximately 4.4 percent of those studied used alternative medicine as a replacement for conventional medicine .
The research found that those having used alternative medicine tended to have higher education or report poorer health status .
Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among that minority using them in lieu of conventional medicine .
Related to this are vigorous marketing of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics .
Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine , due to a lack of private or public health insurance , which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine .
Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market .
In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine , there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth .
One of the most critical is the placebo effect , which is a well-established observation in medicine .
Patients can also be averse to the painful , unpleasant , and sometimes-dangerous side effects of biomedical treatments .
Treatments for severe diseases such as cancer and HIV infection have well-known , significant side-effects .
Even low-risk medications such as antibiotics can have potential to cause life-threatening anaphylactic reactions in a very few individuals .
Also , many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach .
In all of these cases , patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments .
They suggest that this approach may address " ... concerns surrounding CAM use [ and ] encourage informed decision-making about CAM and ultimately , improve outcomes for patients " .
Patients often express interest in mind-body complementary therapies because they offer a non-drug approach to treating some health conditions .
Some mind-body techniques , such as cognitive-behavioral therapy , were once considered complementary medicine , but are now a part of conventional medicine in the United States .

In geometry an Archimedean solid is a highly symmetric , semi-regular convex polyhedron composed of two or more types of regular polygon s meeting in identical vertices .
Sometimes it is instead only required that the faces that meet at one vertex are related isometrically to the faces that meet at the other .
This difference in definitions controls whether the Elongated square gyrobicupola is considered an Archimedean solid or a Johnson solid .
Prisms and antiprism s , whose symmetry groups are the dihedral group s , are generally not considered to be Archimedean solids , despite meeting the above definition .
With this restriction , there are only finitely many Archimedean solids .
They can all be made via Wythoff construction s from the Platonic solids with tetrahedral , octahedral and icosahedral symmetry .
Origin of name The Archimedean solids take their name from Archimedes , who discussed them in a now-lost work .
During the Renaissance , artist s and mathematician s valued pure forms and rediscovered all of these forms .
This search was completed around 1620 by Johannes Kepler , who defined prisms , antiprisms , and the non-convex solids known as the Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra .
Classification There are 13 Archimedean solids ( 15 if the mirror image s of two enantiomorphs , see below , are counted separately ) .
Here the vertex configuration refers to the type of regular polygons that meet at any given vertex .
Some definitions of semiregular polyhedron include one more figure , the elongated square gyrobicupola or " pseudo-rhombicuboctahedron " .
Properties The number of vertices is 720 ° divided by the vertex angle defect .
The cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron are edge-uniform and are called quasi-regular .
The duals of the Archimedean solids are called the Catalan solid s. Together with the bipyramid s and trapezohedra , these are the face-uniform solids with regular vertices .
When something comes in multiple forms which are each other 's three-dimensional mirror image , these forms may be called enantiomorphs .
( This nomenclature is also used for the forms of certain chemical compound s ) .
As faces , it has the two n-gonal bases and , connecting those bases , 2n isosceles triangles .
Uniform antiprism A uniform antiprism has , apart from the base faces , 2n equilateral triangles as faces .
As a class , the uniform antiprisms form an infinite series of vertex-uniform polyhedra , as do the uniform prisms .
For we have as degenerate case the regular tetrahedron , and for the non-degenerate regular octahedron .
The dual polyhedra of the antiprisms are the trapezohedra .
Their existence was first discussed and their name was coined by Johannes Kepler .
The symmetry group contains inversion if and only if n is odd .
The natural history of Africa encompasses some of the well known megafauna of that continent .
Natural history is the study and description of organisms and natural objects , especially their origins , evolution , and interrelationships .
Flora The vegetation of Africa follows very closely the distribution of heat and moisture .
The northern and southern temperate zones have a flora distinct from that of the continent generally , which is tropical .
South of the Atlas Range the conditions alter .
The zones of minimum rainfall have a very scanty flora , consisting of plants adapted to resist the great dryness .
Forests also occur on the humid slopes of mountain ranges up to a certain elevation .
In the coast regions the typical tree is the mangrove , which flourishes wherever the soil is of a swamp character .
The climbing plants in the tropical forests are exceedingly luxuriant and the undergrowth or " bush " is extremely dense .
South Africa is largely destitute of forest save in the lower valleys and coast regions .
Extensive miniature woods of heaths are found in almost endless variety and covered throughout the greater part of the year with innumerable blossoms in which red is very prevalent .
Of the grasses of Africa alfa is very abundant in the plateaus of the Atlas range .
Fauna The fauna again shows the effect of the characteristics of the vegetation .
The okapi ( a genus restricted to Africa ) is found only in the dense forests of the Congo basin .
Bear s are confined to the Atlas region , wolves and fox es to North Africa .
Baboon s and mandrill s , with few exceptions , are peculiar to Africa .
The single-humped camel , as a domestic animal , is especially characteristic of the northern deserts and steppes .
The rivers in the tropical zone abound with hippopotami and crocodile s , the former entirely confined to Africa .
The vast herds of game , formerly so characteristic of many parts of Africa , have much diminished with the increase of intercourse with the interior .
Among the birds most characteristic of Africa are the ostrich and the secretary-bird .
The ostrich is widely dispersed , but is found chiefly in the desert and steppe regions .
The secretary-bird is common in the south .
The weaver bird s and their allies , including the long-tailed whydah s , are abundant , as are , among game-birds , the francolin and guineafowl .
The scorpion is abundant .
The spread of malaria by means of mosquito es is common .
The tsetse fly , whose bite is fatal to all domestic animals , is common in many districts of South and East Africa .
It is found nowhere outside Africa .
Africa is a continent comprising 62 political territories , representing the largest of the great southward projections from the main mass of Earth 's surface .
It includes , within its remarkably regular outline , an area of , including adjacent islands .
For geopolitical purposes , the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt – east of the Suez Canal – is often considered part of Africa .
Africa is thus mainly composed of two segments at right angles , the northern running from east to west , and the southern from north to south .
Moderately elevated tablelands are thus the characteristic feature of the continent , though the surface of these is broken by higher peaks and ridges .
As a general rule , the higher tablelands lie to the east and south , while a progressive diminution in altitude towards the west and north is observable .
S. on the west coast .
On this account South Africa has a general resemblance to an inverted saucer .
Due south the plateau rim is formed by three parallel steps with level ground between them .
The South African plateau is connected towards East African plateau , with probably a slightly greater average elevation , and marked by some distinct features .
Associated with these great valleys are a number of volcanic peaks , the greatest of which occur on a meridional line east of the eastern trough .
Hardly less important is the Ruwenzori Range , over , which lies east of the western trough .
Other volcanic peaks rise from the floor of the valleys , some of the Kirunga ( Mfumbiro ) group , north of Lake Kivu , being still partially active .
There is , however , in the centre a circular basin occupied by Lake Tsana .
In the west the zone of high land is broader but somewhat lower .
Running along the south of desert is the plains region known as the Sahel .
The arid region , the Sahara — the largest desert in the world , covering — extends from the Atlantic to the Red Sea .
That river ( see below ) pierces the desert without modifying its character .
The Atlas range , the north-westerly part of the continent , between its seaward and landward heights encloses elevated steppes in places broad .
From the inner slopes of the plateau numerous wadis take a direction towards the Sahara .
The greater part of that now desert region is , indeed , furrowed by old water-channels .
The main drainage of the continent is to the north and west , or towards the basin of the Atlantic Ocean .
There is also a considerably large lake Malawi stretching along the eastern border of one of the poorest countries in the world - Malawi etc. .
The high lake plateau of East Africa contains the headwaters of both the Nile and the Congo .
The upper Nile receives its chief supplies from the mountainous region adjoining the Central African trough in the neighbourhood of the equator .
To the latter of these , the effluents of the other two lakes add their waters .
The most remote head-stream of the Congo is the Chambezi , which flows southwest into the marshy Lake Bangweulu .
From this lake issues the Congo , known in its upper course by various names .
Flowing first south , it afterwards turns north through Lake Mweru and descends to the forest-clad basin of west equatorial Africa .
West of this is the basin of the Niger , the third major river of Africa .
An important branch , however — the Benue — flows from the southeast .
North of the Senegal , for over 1000 miles ( 1600 km ) of coast , the arid region reaches to the Atlantic .
Farther north are the streams , with comparatively short courses , reaching the Atlantic and Mediterranean from the Atlas mountains .
The main stream has its rise in 11 ° 21 ′ 3 ″ S 24 ° 22 ′ E , at an elevation of .
It flows to the west and south for a considerable distance before turning eastward .
Farther south , the Limpopo drains a portion of the interior plateau , but breaks through the bounding highlands on the side of the continent nearest its source .
Another large stream , the Hawash , rising in the Ethiopian mountains , is lost in a saline depression near the Gulf of Aden .
The largest river is the Omo , which , fed by the rains of the Ethiopian highlands , carries down a large body of water into Lake Rudolf .
The rivers of Africa are generally obstructed either by bars at their mouths , or by cataracts at no great distance upstream .
But when these obstacles have been overcome , the rivers and lakes afford a vast network of navigable waters .
As a rule , the lakes found within the great rift-valleys have steep sides and are very deep .
This is the case with the two largest of the type , Tanganyika and Nyasa , the latter with depths of 430 fathom s ( 790 m ) .
Others , however , are shallow , and hardly reach the steep sides of the valleys in the dry season .
Such are Lake Rukwa , in a subsidiary depression north of Nyasa , and Eiassi and Manyara in the system of the eastern rift-valley .
Lakes of the broad type are of moderate depth , the deepest sounding in Lake Victoria being under 50 fathoms ( 90 m ) .
All , except possibly Mweru , are more or less shallow , and Lake Chad appears to be drying up .
The former view is based on the existence in the lake of organisms of a decidedly marine type .
They include jellyfish , molluscs , prawns , crabs , etc. .
Islands With the exception of Madagascar the African islands are small .
Madagascar , with an area of , is , after Greenland , New Guinea and Borneo , the fourth largest island on the Earth .
Madagascar in its general structure , as in flora and fauna , forms a connecting link between Africa and southern Asia .
East of Madagascar are the small islands of Mauritius and Réunion .
There are also islands in the Gulf of Guinea on which lies the Republic of Sao Tomé and Príncipe ( islands of São Tomé and Príncipe ) .
Socotra lies E.N.E. of Cape Guardafui .
Off the north-west coast are the Canary and Cape Verde archipelagoes .
which , like some small islands in the Gulf of Guinea , are of volcanic origin .
Climate Lying almost entirely within the tropics , and equally to north and south of the equator , Africa does not show excessive variations of temperature .
( The rarity of the air and the great radiation during the night cause the temperature in the Sahara to fall occasionally to freezing point . )
The most important climatic differences are due to variations in the amount of rainfall .
In the inter-tropical zone of summer precipitation , the rainfall is greatest when the sun is vertical or soon after .
It is therefore greatest of all near the equator , where the sun is twice vertical , and less in the direction of both tropics .
Snow falls on all the higher mountain ranges , and on the highest the climate is thoroughly Alpine .
The countries bordering the Sahara are much exposed to a very dry wind , full of fine particles of sand , blowing from the desert towards the sea .
Known in Egypt as the khamsin , on the Mediterranean as the sirocco , it is called on the Guinea coast the harmattan .
This wind is not invariably hot ; its great dryness causes so much evaporation that cold is not infrequently the result .
Similar dry winds blow from the Kalahari Desert in the south .
On the eastern coast the monsoons of the Indian Ocean are regularly felt , and on the southeast hurricanes are occasionally experienced .
Health The climate of Africa lends itself to certain environmental diseases , the most serious of which are : malaria , sleeping sickness and yellow fever .
Malaria is the most deadly environmental disease in Africa .
It is transmitted by a genus of mosquito ( anopheles mosquito ) native to Africa , and can be contracted over and over again .
There is not yet a vaccine for malaria , which makes it difficult to prevent the disease from spreading in Africa .
Recently , the dissemination of mosquito netting has helped lower the rate of malaria .
Yellow fever is a disease also transmitted by mosquitoes native to Africa .
Unlike malaria , it can not be contracted more than once .
Like chicken pox , it is a disease that tends to be severe the later in life a person contracts the disease .
Sleeping sickness , or African trypanosomiasis , is a disease that usually affects animals , but has been known to be fatal to some humans as well .
It is transmitted by the tse tse fly , and is found almost exclusively in Sub-Saharan Africa .
Extreme points These are the points that are farther north , south , east or west than any other location on the continent .
The highest point in Africa is Mount Kilimanjaro , in Tanzania .
The lowest point is Lake Asal , below sea level , in Djibouti .
The winner is the candidate receiving the most votes .
Each voter may vote for any combination of candidates and may give each candidate at most one vote .
Approval voting treats each candidate as an essentially separate question , " Do you approve of this person for the job ? "
Each voter may cast one vote per candidate , either for or against , and whoever receives the most ' Yes ' votes wins .
The system was described in 1976 by Guy Ottewell and also by Robert J. Weber , who coined the term " approval voting . "
It was more fully published in 1978 by political scientist Steven Brams and mathematician Peter Fishburn .
Approval voting can also be compared to plurality voting , without the rule that discards ballots which vote for more than one candidate .
By treating each candidate as a separate question , " Do you approve of this person for the job ? "
approval voting allows each voter to indicate which candidates he or she supports .
All votes count equally , and everyone gets the same number of votes : one vote per candidate , either for or against .
The final tallies show how many voters support each candidate , and the winner is the candidate whom the most voters support .
Approval voting ballots show , for each office being contested , a list of the candidates running for that seat .
Next to each name is a checkbox , or another similar way to mark ' Yes ' or ' No ' for that candidate .
This " check yes or no " approach means approval voting is one of the simplest voting systems to use .
Ballots which mark every candidate the same ( whether yes or no ) have no effect on the outcome of the election .
According to Steven J. Brams and Peter C. Fishburn , the IEEE board in 2002 rescinded its decision to use approval voting .
Dartmouth students started to use approval voting to elect their student body president in 2011 .
In the first election , the winner secured the support of 41 % of voters against several write-in candidates .
In 2012 , Suril Kantaria won with the support of 32 % of the voters .
In 2013 , the winner earned the support of just under 40 % of the voters .
A form of approval voting is used by the Web site TV Tropes for certain decisions , including names of pages that need to be renamed .
The system allows for a vote to be cast in favor of or against each proposed name .
The effect of this system as an electoral reform measure is not without critics , however .
FairVote has a position paper arguing that approval voting has three flaws that undercut it as a method of voting and political vehicle .
Le Pen lost by a very high margin in the runoff , 82.2 % to 17.8 % , a sign that the true top two had not been found .
Le Pen , in that study , would have received 25.1 % .
In the real primary election , the top three were Chirac , 19.9 % , Le Pen , 16.9 % , and Jospin , 16.2 % .
A generalized version of the Burr dilemma applies to approval voting when two candidates are appealing to the same subset of voters .
Compromising occurs when a voter approves an additional candidate who is otherwise considered unacceptable to the voter , in order to prevent an even worse alternative from winning .
This definition allows a sincere vote to treat strictly preferred candidates the same , ensuring that every voter has at least one sincere vote .
The definition also allows a sincere vote to treat equally preferred candidates differently .
When there are two or more candidates , every voter has at least three sincere approval votes to choose from .
Two of those sincere approval votes do not distinguish between any of the candidates : vote for none of the candidates and vote for all of the candidates .
When there are three or more candidates , every voter has more than one sincere approval vote that distinguishes between the candidates .
Sincere strategy with ordinal preferences A sincere voter with multiple options for voting sincerely still has to choose which sincere vote to use .
Voting strategy is a way to make that choice , in which case strategic approval voting includes sincere voting , rather than being an alternative to it .
This differs from other voting systems that typically have a unique sincere vote for a voter .
When there are three or more candidates , the winner of an approval voting election can change , depending on which sincere votes are used .
In some cases , approval voting can sincerely elect any one of the candidates , including a Condorcet winner and a Condorcet loser , without the voter preferences changing .
In one sense , conditions where this can happen are robust and are not isolated cases .
Dichotomous preferences Approval voting avoids the issue of multiple sincere votes in special cases when voters have dichotomous preferences .
For a voter with dichotomous preferences , approval voting is strategy-proof ( also known as strategy-free ) .
When all voters have dichotomous preferences and vote the sincere , strategy-proof vote , approval voting is guaranteed to elect the Condorcet winner , if one exists .
However , having dichotomous preferences when there are three or more candidates is not typical .
It is an unlikely situation for all voters to have dichotomous preferences when there are more than a few voters .
Having dichotomous preferences means that a voter has bi-level preferences for the candidates .
A voter that has strict preferences between three candidates — prefers A to B and B to C — does not have dichotomous preferences .
In approval voting , the strategy-proof vote , if it exists , is a sincere vote .
Approval threshold Another way to deal with multiple sincere votes is to augment the ordinal preference model with an approval or acceptance threshold .
An approval threshold divides all of the candidates into two sets , those the voter approves of and those the voter does not approve of .
A voter can approve of more than one candidate and still prefer one approved candidate to another approved candidate .
Acceptance thresholds are similar .
With such a threshold , a voter simply votes for every candidate that meets or exceeds the threshold .
With threshold voting , it is still possible to not elect the Condorcet winner and instead elect the Condorcet loser when they both exist .
However , according to Steven Brams , this represents a strength rather than a weakness of approval voting .
Without providing specifics , he argues that the pragmatic judgements of voters about which candidates are acceptable should take precedence over the Condorcet criterion and other social choice criteria .
Strategy with cardinal utilities Voting strategy under approval is guided by two competing features of approval voting .
On the one hand , approval voting fails the later-no-harm criterion , so voting for a candidate can cause that candidate to win instead of a more preferred candidate .
Either way , the voter can risk getting a less preferred election winner .
A rational voter model described by Myerson and Weber specifies an approval voting strategy that votes for those candidates that have a positive prospective rating .
An optimal approval vote will always vote for the most preferred candidate and not vote for the least preferred candidate .
However , an optimal vote can require voting for a candidate and not voting for a more preferred candidate if there 4 candidates or more .
Other strategies are also available and will coincide with the optimal strategy in special situations .
For example : Another strategy is to vote for the top half of the candidates , the candidates that have an above-median utility .
Optimal strategic approval voting fails to satisfy the Condorcet criterion and can elect a Condorcet loser .
Strategic approval voting can guarantee electing the Condorcet winner in some special circumstances .
Using these utilities , voters will choose their optimal strategic votes based on what they think the various pivot probabilities are for pairwise ties .
In each of the scenarios summarized below , all voters share a common set of pivot probabilities .
In the first scenario , voters all choose their votes based on the assumption that all pairwise ties are equally likely .
As a result , they vote for any candidate with an above-average utility .
Most voters vote for only their first choice .
Only the Knoxville faction also votes for its second choice , Chattanooga .
As a result , the winner is Memphis , the Condorcet loser , with Chattanooga coming in second place .
Each of the remaining scenarios follows a similar pattern of expectations and voting strategies .
In the second scenario , there is a three-way tie for first place .
This happens because the expected winner , Memphis , was the Condorcet loser and was also ranked last by any voter that did not rank it first .
Only in the last scenario does the actual winner and runner-up match the expected winner and runner-up .
As a result , this can be considered a stable strategic voting scenario .
In the language of game theory , this is an " equilibrium . "
In this scenario , the winner is also the Condorcet winner .
Compliance with voting system criteria Most of the mathematical criteria by which voting systems are compared were formulated for voters with ordinal preferences .
In this case , approval voting requires voters to make an additional decision of where to put their approval cutoff ( see examples above ) .
Depending on how this decision is made , approval voting satisfies different sets of criteria .
This does not provide proportional representation and is subject to the Burr dilemma , among other problems .
Other ways of extending Approval voting to multiple winner elections have been devised .
Among these are proportional approval voting for determining a proportional assembly , and Minimax Approval for determining a consensus assembly where the least satisfied voter is satisfied the most .
Ballot types Approval ballots can be of at least four semi-distinct forms .
The simplest form is a blank ballot where the names of supported candidates are written in by hand .
A more structured ballot will list all the candidates and allow a mark or word to be made by each supported candidate .
A more explicit structured ballot can list the candidates and give two choices by each .
( Candidate list ballots can include spaces for write-in candidates as well . )
All four ballots are theoretically equivalent .
The more structured ballots may aid voters in offering clear votes so they explicitly know all their choices .
The " single bubble " format is incapable of producing invalid ballots ( which might otherwise be rejected in counting ) .
Thus , making secure " chain of custody " of ballots is more important in Approval voting than in other voting systems .
ASU is the largest public university in the United States by enrollment .
A 1958 statewide ballot measure gave the university its present name ; thus , making Arizona State one of the nation 's newest public research universities .
A goal of the university is to meet Association of American Universities ( AAU ) criteria and to become a member .
All four campuses are accredited as a single institution by the Higher Learning Commission .
More than 1.5 million sq. ft. of new research space has been added to the university 's research facilities since 2002 .
ASU 's athletic teams compete in Division I of the NCAA and are collectively known as the Arizona State Sun Devils .
They are members of the Pacific-12 Conference and have won 23 national championships .
With the continued growth of the student population , ASU has recently undergone numerous renovations across each of its campuses , including expansion of student recreational facilities and dormitories .
The demand for more student housing on campus is being addressed with public/private investment .
Instruction was instituted on February 8 , 1886 under the supervision of Principal Hiram Bradford Farmer .
Land for the school was donated by Tempe residents George and Martha Wilson , allowing 33 students to meet in a single room .
At the beginning of the 20th century , the school 's name was changed from Tempe Normal School to the Arizona State Teachers College at Tempe .
Before becoming a college , the Normal School enrolled high school students with no other secondary education facilities .
Under the 30 year tenure of president Arthur John Matthews the school was given all-college student status .
The first dormitories built in the state were constructed under his supervision .
Of the 18 buildings constructed while Matthews was president , six are still currently in use .
Matthews envisioned an " evergreen campus , " with many shrubbery brought to the campus .
He also implemented the planting of Palm Walk , now one of the feature landmarks of the Tempe campus .
His legacy is being continued to this day with the main campus having the honor of being declared a nationally recognized arboretum .
During the Great Depression , Ralph W. Swetman was hired as president for a three-year term .
Although enrollment increased by almost 100 % during his tenure due to the depression , many faculty were terminated and faculty salaries were cut .
Like his predecessor , Gammage oversaw the construction of a number of buildings on the Tempe campus .
Dr. Gammage oversaw the development of the university , graduate programs , and the renaming of the Arizona State College to Arizona State University in 1958 .
On July 1 , 2002 , Michael Crow became the university 's 16th president .
At his inauguration , President Crow outlined his vision for transforming ASU into a " New American University " — one that would be open and inclusive .
Along with the research facilities , the university faculty was expanded , including the addition of three Nobel Laureates .
In addition , ASU 's Downtown Phoenix campus was vastly expanded with several of the University 's colleges and schools relocated to the downtown campus .
The economic downturn that began in 2008 took a particularly hard toll on Arizona , resulting in large cuts to ASU 's budget .
The university plans to establish the Arizona Center for Law and Society in 2016 .
Organization and Administration The Arizona Board of Regents governs Arizona State University as well as the other state 's public universities ; University of Arizona and Northern Arizona University .
The Board of Regents is composed of twelve members including eleven voting , and one non-voting member .
ABOR provides policy guidance to the state universities of Arizona .
It also offers courses and degrees through ASU online to advance the mission of the university .
The Arizona Board of Regents appoints and elects the president of the university , who is considered the chief executive officer and the chief budget officer of the institution .
The president also selects and appoints administrative officers and general counsels .
The 16th and current ASU president is Michael M. Crow , and has served since July 1 , 2002 .
The university considers each campus " distinctive " and academically focused on certain aspects of the overall university mission .
The Tempe Campus is the university 's research and graduate school center .
Undergraduate studies on the Tempe campus are research-based programs designed to prepare students for graduate school , professional school , or employment .
The Polytechnic campus is designed with an emphasis on professional and technological programs for direct workforce preparation .
The Polytechnic campus is the location of many of the university 's simulators and laboratories dedicated for project-based learning .
The West campus is focused on interdisciplinary degrees and the liberal arts , while maintaining professional programs with a direct impact on the community and society .
The Downtown Campus focuses on direct urban and public programs such as nursing , public policy , mass communication , and journalism .
ASU recently relocated some nursing and health related programs to its new ASU-Mayo Medical School Campus .
Inter-campus shuttles and light rail allow students and faculty to easily travel between the campuses .
In addition to the physical campuses , ASU 's " virtual campus " , housed at the university 's SkySong Innovation Center , provides online and extended education .
Tempe campus ASU 's Tempe campus is located in downtown Tempe , Arizona , about eight miles ( 13 km ) east of downtown Phoenix .
The campus is considered urban , and is approximately in size .
The campus is arranged around broad pedestrian malls and is completely encompassed by an arboretum .
The Tempe campus is also the largest of ASU 's campuses , with 59,794 students enrolled in at least one class on campus .
The Tempe campus is ASU 's original campus , and Old Main , the first building constructed , still stands today .
The Tempe campus is also home to all of the university 's athletic facilities .
West campus The West campus was established in 1984 by the Arizona Legislature and sits on in a suburban area of northwest Phoenix .
The West campus lies about northwest of downtown Phoenix , and about northwest of the Tempe campus .
The West campus is designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride , and is nearly completely powered by a 4.6 MW solar array .
The campus , patterned after the University of Oxford ’s architecture , has recently opened a new residence hall , dining facility and recreation center .
The campus is located in southeast Mesa , Arizona , approximately southeast of the Tempe campus , and southeast of downtown Phoenix .
The Polytechnic campus sits on the former Williams Air Force Base .
Downtown Phoenix campus The newest of ASU 's four campuses , the Downtown Phoenix campus was established in 2006 on the north side of Downtown Phoenix .
The campus has an urban design , with several large modern academic buildings intermingled with commercial and retail office buildings .
Colleges @ ASU In response to demands for lower-cost public higher education in Arizona , ASU is developing a number of small , undergraduate-only college locations throughout Arizona .
Colleges @ ASU locations will be teaching-focused , and will provide a selection of popular undergraduate majors .
The first is being planned for Lake Havasu City with programs available as early as fall 2012 .
Online degree programs ASU offers more than 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs through an entirely online platform , known as ASU Online .
Online students are taught by the same faculty and receive the same diploma as on-campus students .
As of spring 2012 , more than 5,000 students were enrolled at ASU Online .
ASU Online is headquartered at ASU 's SkySong campus in Scottsdale , Arizona .
ASU Online was ranked # 1 in online Student Services and Technology by U.S. News and World Report .
ASU-Mayo Medical School Campus In late 2011 , ASU launched a collaboration with the Mayo Clinic to create a medical school .
As part of the collaboration with Mayo , ASU moved some academic departments onto the Mayo Clinic campus in Scottsdale , Arizona .
Mayo Medical and ASU have instituted an undergraduate " Pre-medical Scholar Program " to further the ASU Clinical partnering program mission .
A partnership with organizations and hospitals throughout the region has been created .
The partnership will help establish a network for knowledge sharing and testing of innovation .
Real-world training for students researching medical issues affecting the community will be a priority of the school .
ASU-Mayo Medical School plans to begin enrolling the first students in 2014 .
In preparation for the medical school opening , ASU began offering health and nursing degree programs on the Mayo Clinic Campus .
The program at the ASU-Mayo Clinic Campus began in the Fall of 2012 and provides a education in world-class medical facilities to its students .
In 2012-2013 , ASU admitted 88.9 % of all applicants and is considered a " selective " university by U.S. News and World Report .
Average GPA of high school graduates enrolling full-time is 3.42 .
Barrett , The Honors College is ranked 1st in the nation among peer institutions ( 1300-1400 minimum SAT ) and 5th in Overall Excellence among all universities .
Furthermore , Barrett College provides a more rigorous curriculum with smaller classes and increased faculty interaction .
The Honors college enrolls 3523 undergraduate students , 613 of whom are National Merit Scholars .
These programs are divided into 15 colleges and schools which are spread across ASU 's four campuses .

Traditions Maroon and Gold Gold is the oldest color associated with Arizona State University and dates back to 1896 when the school was named the Tempe Normal School .
Maroon and white were later added to the color scheme in 1898 .
Gold signifies the “ golden promise ” of ASU .
The promise includes every student receiving a valuable educational experience .
Gold also signifies the sunshine Arizona is famous for ; including the power of the sun and its influence on the climate and the economy .

The student section , known as The Inferno , wears gold on game days .
Mascot and Spirit Squad Sparky the Sun Devil is the mascot of Arizona State University and was named by vote of the student body on November 8 , 1946 .
Sparky often travels with the team across the country and has been at every football bowl game in which the university has participated in .
The new logo and emblem are used on various university property , sport facilities , uniforms and documents .
Arizona State Teacher ’s College had a different mascot and the sports teams were known as the Owls and later , the Bulldogs .
When the school was first established , the Tempe Normal School ’s teams were simply known as the Normals .
Sparky is visible on the sidelines of every home game played in Sun Devil Stadium or other ASU athletic facilities .
His routine at football games includes pushups after every touchdown scored by the Sun Devils .
He is aided by Sparky 's Crew , male yell leaders that must meet physical requirements in order to participate as members .

It was described as a tradition of " good will between the classes " and a way of ensuring new students would continue the university 's traditions with honor .
In modern times , the participants walk through campus and follow a path up to “ A ” Mountain in order to “ light up ” Tempe .
Keynote speakers , performances , and other events are used to mark the occasion .
The night is culminated with a fireworks display .
It is held in the fall and in conjunction with a football game .

Astoria attracted a host of immigrants beginning in the late-19th century : Nordic settlers , primarily Finns , and Chinese soon became significant parts of the population .
Frantic citizens resorted to dynamite , blowing up entire buildings to stop the fire from going further .
Astoria 's economy centered on fishing , fish processing , and lumber .
From 1921 to 1966 , a ferry route across the Columbia River connected Astoria with Pacific County , Washington .

Alarums and excursions " is a stage direction for the moving of soldiers across a stage , used in Elizabethan drama .
He wrote plays , novels , poetry , essays and speculative journalism .
His texts present some pioneering work in the field of absurdist literature .
Sometimes grotesque or misunderstood ( e.g. the opening line in his play Ubu Roi , " Merdre ! "
, has been translated into English as " Pshit ! "
, " Shitteth ! "
, " Shittr ! "
, " Shikt ! "
, " Shrit ! "
, " Pschitt ! "
, and " Shitsky ! " )
, he invented a fictional type of philosophy called ' pataphysics .
Biography and works A precociously brilliant student , Jarry enthralled his classmates with a gift for pranks and troublemaking .
Jarry and classmate Henri Morin wrote a play they called Les Polonais and performed it with marionettes in the home of one of their friends .
In Jarry 's later work Ubu Roi , Père Heb would develop into Ubu , one of the most monstrous and astonishing characters in French literature .
At 17 Jarry passed his baccalauréat and moved to Paris to prepare for admission to the École Normale Supérieure .
Though he was not admitted , he soon gained attention for his original poems and prose-poems .
A collection of his work , Les minutes de sable mémorial , was published in 1893 .
That same year , both his parents died , leaving him a small inheritance which he quickly spent .
Jarry had meantime discovered the pleasures of alcohol , which he called " my sacred herb " or , when referring to absinthe , the " green goddess " .
A story is told that he once painted his face green and rode through town on his bicycle in its honour ( and possibly under its influence ) .
When he was drafted into the army in 1894 , his gift for turning notions upside down defeated attempts to instill military discipline .
Eventually the army discharged him for medical reasons .
His military experience eventually inspired the novel Days and Nights .
Jarry returned to Paris and applied himself to drinking , writing , and the company of friends who appreciated his witty , sweet-tempered , and unpredictable conversation .
Symbolism as an art movement was in full swing at this time and L'Ymagier provided a nexus for many of its key contributors .
Jarry 's play Caesar Antichrist ( 1895 ) drew on this movement for material .
This is a work that bridges the gap between serious symbolic meaning and the type of critical absurdity with which Jarry would soon become associated .
Ubu Rois savage humor and monstrous absurdity , unlike anything thus far performed in French theater , seemed unlikely to ever actually be performed on stage .
However , impetuous theater director Aurélien-Marie Lugné-Poe took the risk , producing the play at his Théâtre de l'Oeuvre .
( " Shittr ! " ) .
Such interruptions continued through the evening .
At the time , only the dress rehearsal and opening night performance were held , and the play was not revived until after Jarry 's death .
The play brought fame to the 23-year-old Jarry , and he immersed himself in the fiction he had created .
Gémier had modeled his portrayal of Ubu on Jarry 's own staccato , nasal vocal delivery , which emphasized each syllable ( even the silent ones ) .
From then on , Jarry would always speak in this style .
Jarry moved into a flat which the landlord had created through the unusual expedient of subdividing a larger flat by means of a horizontal rather than a vertical partition .
The diminutive Jarry could just manage to stand up in the place , but guests had to bend or crouch .
Jarry also took to carrying a loaded revolver .
With Franc-Nohain and Claude Terrasse , he co-founded the Théatre des Pantins , which in 1898 was the site of marionette performances of Ubu Roi .
Pataphysics deals with " the laws which govern exceptions and will explain the universe supplementary to this one " .
In ' pataphysics , every event in the universe is accepted as an extraordinary event .
In his final years , he was a legendary and heroic figure to some of the young writers and artists in Paris .
Guillaume Apollinaire , André Salmon , and Max Jacob sought him out in his truncated apartment .
Jarry lived in his ' pataphysical world until his death in Paris on 1 November 1907 of tuberculosis , aggravated by drug and alcohol use .
It is recorded that his last request was for a toothpick .
He was interred in the Cimetière de Bagneux , near Paris .

Amalric was the second son of Melisende of Jerusalem and Fulk of Jerusalem , and succeeded his older brother Baldwin III .
During his reign , Jerusalem became more closely allied with the Byzantine Empire , and the two states launched an unsuccessful invasion of Egypt .
Meanwhile , the Muslim territories surrounding Jerusalem began to be united under Nur ad-Din and later Saladin .
He was the father of three future rulers of Jerusalem , Sibylla , Baldwin IV , and Isabella I .
Melisende did not step down when Baldwin came of age two years later , and by 1150 the two were becoming increasingly hostile towards each other .
In 1152 Baldwin had himself crowned sole king , and civil war broke out , with Melisende retaining Jerusalem while Baldwin held territory further north .
Melisende was defeated in this struggle and Baldwin ruled alone thereafter .
In 1153 Baldwin captured the Egypt ian fortress of Ascalon , which was then added to Amalric 's fief of Jaffa ( see Battle of Ascalon ) .
Amalric married Agnes of Courtenay in 1157 .
Agnes , daughter of Joscelin II of Edessa , had lived in Jerusalem since the western regions of the former crusader County of Edessa were lost in 1150 .
Nevertheless , consanguinity was enough for the opposition .
Agnes soon thereafter married Hugh of Ibelin , to whom she had been engaged before her marriage with Amalric .
The church ruled that Amalric and Agnes ' children were legitimate and preserved their place in the order of succession .
Through her children Agnes would exert much influence in Jerusalem for almost 20 years .
Zengi united Aleppo , Mosul , and other cities of northern Syria , and intended to impose his control on Damascus in the south .
The Second Crusade in 1148 had failed to conquer Damascus , which soon fell to Zengi 's son Nur ad-Din .
Jerusalem also lost influence to Byzantium in northern Syria when the Empire imposed its suzerainty over the Principality of Antioch .
Jerusalem thus turned its attention to Egypt , where the Fatimid dynasty was suffering from a series of young caliph s and civil wars .
The crusaders had wanted to conquer Egypt since the days of Baldwin I , who died during an expedition there .
The capture of Ascalon by Baldwin III made the conquest of Egypt more feasible .
The Egyptians then opened up the Nile dams and let the river flood , hoping to prevent Amalric from invading any further .
Amalric returned home but Shawar fled to the court of Nur ad-Din , who sent his general Shirkuh to settle the dispute in 1164 .
In response Dirgham sought help from Amalric , but Shirkuh and Shawar arrived before Amalric could intervene and Dirgham was killed .
Shawar , however , feared that Shirkuh would seize power for himself , and he too looked to Amalric for assistance .
Amalric returned to Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh in Bilbeis until Shirkuh retreated to Damascus .
Amalric rushed to take up the regency of Antioch and Tripoli and secured Bohemund 's ransom in 1165 ( Raymond remained in captivity until 1173 ) .
Shirkuh encamped on the opposite side of the Nile .
Shirkuh negotiated for peace and Alexandria was handed over to Amalric .
However , Amalric could not remain there indefinitely , and returned to Jerusalem after exacting an enormous tribute .
Byzantine alliance After his return to Jerusalem in 1167 , Amalric married Maria Comnena , a great-grandniece of Byzantine emperor Manuel I Comnenus .
The negotiations had taken two years , mostly because Amalric insisted that Manuel return Antioch to Jerusalem .
Once Amalric gave up on this point he was able to marry Maria in Tyre on August 29 , 1167 .
It was also around this time that William of Tyre was promoted to archdeacon of Tyre , and was recruited by Amalric to write a history of the kingdom .
In 1168 Amalric and Manuel negotiated an alliance against Egypt , and William of Tyre was among the ambassadors sent to Constantinople to finalize the treaty .
Although Amalric still had a peace treaty with Shawar , Shawar was accused of attempting to ally with Nur ad-Din , and Amalric invaded .
The Knights Hospitaller eagerly supported this invasion , while the Knights Templar refused to have any part in it .
In October , without waiting for any Byzantine assistance ( and in fact without even waiting for the ambassadors to return ) , Amalric invaded and seized Bilbeis .
The inhabitants were either massacred or enslaved .
Amalric then marched to Cairo , where Shawar offered Amalric two million pieces of gold .
Meanwhile Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh back to Egypt as well , and upon his arrival Amalric retreated .
Rise of Saladin In January 1169 Shirkuh had Shawar assassinated .
Shirkuh became vizier , although he himself died in March , and was succeeded by his nephew Saladin .
Later that year however a Byzantine fleet arrived , and in October Amalric launched yet another invasion and besieged Damietta by sea and by land .
Now Jerusalem was surrounded by hostile enemies .
In 1170 Saladin invaded Jerusalem and took the city of Eilat , severing Jerusalem 's connection with the Red Sea .
Saladin , who was set up as Vizier of Egypt , was declared Sultan in 1171 upon the death of the last Fatimid caliph .
Saladin 's rise to Sultan was an unexpected reprieve for Jerusalem , as Nur ad-Din was now preoccupied with reining in his powerful vassal .
Nevertheless , in 1171 Amalric visited Constantinople himself and envoys were sent to the kings of Europe for a second time , but again no help was received .
Death Nur ad-Din died in 1174 , upon which Amalric immediately besieged Banias .
On the way back after giving up the siege he fell ill from dysentery , which was ameliorated by doctors but turned into a fever in Jerusalem .
Neither they nor Latin doctors could help , and he died on July 11 , 1174 .
On his deathbed Amalric bequeathed Nablus to Maria and Isabella , both of whom would retire there .
The leprous child Baldwin IV succeeded his father and brought his mother Agnes of Courtenay ( now married to her fourth husband ) back to court .
Physical characteristics William was a good friend of Amalric and described him in great detail . "
He had a slight impediment in his speech , not serious enough to be considered as a defect but sufficient to render him incapable of ready eloquence .
He was far better in counsel than in fluent or ornate speech . "
He was probably responsible for an assize making all rear-vassals directly subject to the king and eligible to appear at the Haute Cour .
Amalric had an enormous curiosity , and William was reportedly astonished to find Amalric questioning , during an illness , the resurrection of the body .
He especially enjoyed reading and being read to , spending long hours listening to William read early drafts of his history .
He did not enjoy games or spectacles , although he liked to hunt .
A comely and very full beard covered his cheeks and chin .
He had a way of laughing immoderately so that his entire body shook . "
As William says , " he was a man of wisdom and discretion , fully competent to hold the reins of government in the kingdom . "
He is considered the last of the " early " kings of Jerusalem , after whom there was no king able to save Jerusalem from its eventual collapse .
Within a few years , Emperor Manuel died as well , and Saladin remained the only strong leader in the east .
The Lusignan family was noted for its many Crusaders .
Amalric and Guy were sons of Hugh VIII of Lusignan , who had himself campaigned in the Holy Land in the 1160s .
Amalric married Eschiva , daughter of Baldwin of Ibelin .
He then took service with Agnes of Courtenay , wife of Reginald of Sidon and mother of Baldwin IV of Jerusalem .

He was the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the second half of the 12th century , and was the closest advisor of King Valdemar I of Denmark .
He combined the ideals of Gregorian Reform ideals with loyal support of a strong monarch ical power .
Absalon was born into the powerful Hvide clan , and owned great land possessions .
He endowed several church institutions , most prominently his family 's Sorø Abbey .
He was granted lands by the crown , and built the first fortification of the city that evolved into modern-day Copenhagen .
His titles were passed on to his nephews Anders Sunesen and Peder Sunesen .
He died in 1201 , and was interred at Sorø Abbey .
Early life Absalon was born around 1128 near Sorø , Zealand .
Due to a name which is unusual in Denmark , it is speculated that he was christened on the Danish " Absalon " name day , October 30 .
He was the son of Asser Rig , a magnate of the Hvide clan from Fjenneslev on Zealand .
He was also a kinsman of Archbishop Eskil of Lund .
At Paris , he was influenced by the Gregorian Reform ideals of churchly independence from Monarchical rule .
He also befriended the canon William of Æbelholt at the Abbey of St Genevieve , whom he later made abbott of Eskilsø Abbey .
He was a guest at following Roskilde banquet given in 1157 by Sweyn to his rivals Canute V and Valdemar .
Both Absalon and Valdemar narrowly escaped assassination at the hands of Sweyn on this occasion , and escaped to Jutland , whither Sweyn followed them .
Bishop and advisor Absalon was a close counsellor of Valdemar , and chief promotor of the Danish crusade s against the Wends .
During the Danish civil war , Denmark had been open to coastal raids by the Wends .
It was Absalon 's intention to clear the Baltic Sea of the Wendish pirates who inhabited its southern littoral zone which was later called Pomerania .
Absalon formed a guardian fleet , built coastal defenses , and led several campaigns against the Wends .
He even advocated forgiving the earlier enemies of Valdemar , which helped stabilize Denmark internally .
Wendish campaigns The first expedition against the Wends that was conducted by Absalon in person , set out in 1160 .
These expeditions were successful , but brought no lasting victories .
What started out as mere retribution , eventually evolved into full-fledged campaigns of expansion with religious crusader motives .
In 1164 began twenty years of crusades against the Wends , sometimes with the help of German duke Henry the Lion , sometimes in opposition to him .
In 1168 the chief Wendish fortress at Arkona in Rügen , containing the sanctuary of their god Svantevit , was conquered .
The Wends agreed to accept Danish suzerainty and the Christian religion at the same time .
From Arkona , Absalon proceeded by sea to Charenza , in the midst of Rügen , the political capital of the Wends and an all but impregnable stronghold .
But the unexpected fall of Arkona had terrified the garrison , which surrendered unconditionally at the first appearance of the Danish ships .
The whole population of Garz was then baptized , and Absalon laid the foundations of twelve churches in the isle of Rügen .
Rügen was then subjected to Absalon 's Bishopric of Roskilde .
The destruction of this chief sally-port of the Wendish pirates enabled Absalon considerably to reduce the Danish fleet .
Policies Absalon 's main political goal was to free Denmark from entanglements with the Holy Roman Empire .
Absalon reformed the Danish church organisation to closer match Holy See praxis , and worked to keep Denmark a close ally of the Holy See .
This caused a split within the Danish church , as it possibly forced Eskil into exile around 1161 , despite Abaslon 's attempts to keep the Danish church united .
It was contrary to Absalon 's advice and warnings that Valdemar I rendered fealty to the emperor Frederick Barbarossa at Dole in 1162 .
When Valdemar returned to Denmark , he was convinced into strengthening the Danevirke fortifications at the German border , with the support of Absalon .
Absalon built churches and monasteries , supporting international religious orders like the Cistercians and Augustinians , founding schools and doing his utmost to promote civilization and enlightenment .
In 1162 , Absalon transformed the Sorø Abbey of his family from Benedictine to Cistercian , granting it lands from his personal holdings .
Havn quickly expanded as one of Scandinavia 's most important centers of trade , and eventually evolved into modern-day Copenhagen .
It was also Absalon who held the first Danish Synod at Lund in 1167 .
He was also interested in history and culture , and commissioned Saxo Grammaticus to write Gesta Danorum , a comprehensive chronicle of the history of the Danes .
Eventual violation of the law was specified as subject to a secular legal process .
Archbishop of Lund Archbishop Eskil returned from exile in 1167 .
Eskil agreed on canonizing Valdemar 's father Knud Lavard in 1170 , with Absalon assisting him at the feast .
When Eskil stepped down as Archbishop of Lund in 1177 , he chose Absalon as his successor .
By a unique Papal dispensation , Absalon was allowed to simultaneously maintain his post as Bishop of Roskilde .
As the Archbishop of Lund , Absalon utilized ombudsmen from Zealand , demanded unfree labour from the peasantry , and instituted tithes .
He was a harsh and effective ruler , who cleared all Orthodox Christian liturgic remnants in favour of Papal standards .
A rebellion in the Scania n peasantry forced him to flee to Zealand in 1180 , from where he returned and subdued the Scanians with the help of Valdemar .
When Valdemar died in 1182 , his son succeeded him as Canute VI , and Absalon served as Canute VI 's counsellor .
Under Canute VI , Absalon was the chief policymaker in Danish politics .
Absalon kept his hostile attitude to the Holy Roman Empire .
This represented the final Danish rejection of German supremacy .
He instead confined himself to the administration of the Danish empire .
In 1192 , Absalon made his nephew Peder Sunesen his successor as Bishop of Roskilde , while his other nephew Anders Sunesen was named the chancellor of Canute VI .
He had already given Copenhagen to the Bishopric of Roskilde .
Absalon was interred at Sorø Abbey , and was succeeded as Archbishop of Lund by Anders Sunesen .
Absalon left a legacy as the foremost politician and churchfather of Denmark in the 12th century .
Absalon was equally great as churchman , statesman and warrior .
His policy of expansion was to give Denmark the dominion of the Baltic for three generations .
Absalon never neglected his ecclesiastical duties , and even his wars were of the nature of crusades .
In the 2000s , " Absalon " was adopted as the name for a class of Royal Danish Navy vessels , and the lead vessel of the class .
HDMS Absalon ( L16 ) and Esbern Snare ( L17 ) were launched and commissioned by Denmark in 2004 and 2005 .
In December 2008 , HDMS Absalon was involved in the rescue of putative Somali pirates 90 miles off Yemen in the Gulf of Aden .
The craft from Somalia was reported to hold rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47 assault rifles , and to have been adrift for several days .
Also per the report , the Absalon took the sailors and weapons aboard , sunk the craft , and turned the sailors over to the Yemen coast guard .
Whilst Raymond and the other leaders often quarrelled with each other over the leadership of the crusade , Adhemar was always recognized as the spiritual leader of the crusade .
When Kerbogha was defeated , Adhemar organized a council in an attempt to settle the leadership disputes , but he died on 1 August 1098 , probably of typhus .
The disputes among the higher nobles went unsolved , and the march to Jerusalem was delayed for months .
This was done , and Jerusalem was taken by the Crusaders in 1099 .
Life Born at Poissy , Alphonse was a son of Louis VIII , King of France and Blanche of Castile .
He was a younger brother of Louis IX of France and an older brother of Charles I of Sicily .
In 1229 , his mother , who was regent of France , forced the Treaty of Paris on Raymond VII of Toulouse after his rebellion .
It stipulated that a brother of King Louis was to marry Joan of Toulouse , daughter of Raymond VII of Toulouse , and so in 1237 Alphonse married her .
Since she was Raymond 's only child , they became rulers of Toulouse at Raymond 's death in 1249 .
By the terms of his father 's will he received an appanage of Poitou and Auvergne .
He won the battle of Taillebourg in the Saintonge War with his brother Louis IX , against a revolt allied with king Henry III of England .
Alphonse took part in two crusades with his brother , St Louis , in 1248 ( the Seventh Crusade ) and in 1270 ( the Eighth Crusade ) .
He sailed for home on 10 August 1250 .
His father-in-law had died while he was away , and he went directly to Toulouse to take possession .
The county of Toulouse , since them , was joined to the Alphonse 's appanage .
In 1252 , on the death of his mother , Blanche of Castile , Alphonse was joint regent with Charles of Anjou until the return of Louis IX .
His main work was on his own estates .
There he repaired the evils of the Albigensian war and made a first attempt at administrative centralization , thus preparing the way for union with the crown .
The charter known as " Alphonsine , " granted to the town of Riom , became the code of public law for Auvergne .
He is noted for ordering the first recorded local expulsion of Jew s , when he did so in Poitou in 1249 .
When Louis IX again engaged in a crusade ( the Eighth Crusade ) , Alphonse again raised a large sum of money and accompanied his brother .
This time , however , he did not return to France , dying while on his way back , probably at Savona in Italy , on 21 August 1271 .
Death and Legacy Alphonse 's death without heirs raised some questions as to the succession to his lands .
One possibility was that they should revert to the crown , another that they should be redistributed to his family .
Alphonse 's wife Joan ( who died five days after Alphonse ) had attempted to dispose of some of her inherited lands in her will .

Ambroise followed Richard I as a noncombatant , and not improbably as a court - minstrel .
He shows no greater political insight than we should expect from his position ; but relates what he had seen and heard with a naïve vivacity which compels attention .
He is rather to be treated as a biographer than as a historian of the Crusade in its broader aspects .
Nonetheless he is an interesting primary source for the events of the years 1190 – 1192 in the Kingdom of Jerusalem .
They were formerly sometimes regarded as the first-hand narrative on which Ambroise based his work , but that can no longer be maintained .

It is an eclectic style that combines traditional craft motifs with Machine Age imagery and materials .
The style is often characterized by rich colors , bold geometric shapes , and lavish ornamentation .
Deco emerged from the Interwar period when rapid industrialization was transforming culture .
One of its major attributes is an embrace of technology .
This distinguishes Deco from the organic motifs favored by its predecessor Art Nouveau .
During its heyday Art Deco represented luxury , glamour , exuberance , and faith in social and technological progress .
He was referring to the 1925 Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes ( International Exposition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts ) .
Here the phrase was used to distinguish French decorative crafts of the Belle Epoque from those of later periods .
However Art Deco originated in France .
It has been argued that the term should be applied to French works and those produced in countries directly influenced by France .
In 1971 Hillier organized an exhibition at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts then published a book about it : The World of Art Deco .
Origins Some historians trace Deco 's roots to the Universal Exposition of 1900 .
After this show a group of artists established an informal collective known as La Société des artistes décorateurs ( Society of Decorator Artists ) to promote French crafts .
Among them were Hector Guimard , Eugène Grasset , Raoul Lachenal , Paul Bellot , Maurice Dufrêne , and Emile Decoeur .
These artists are said to have influenced the principles of Art Deco .
The Art Deco era is often dated from 1925 when the Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes was organized to showcase new ideas in applied arts .
During the 1920s affordable travel permitted in situ exposure to other cultures .
There was also popular interest in archeology due to excavations at Pompeii , Troy , the tomb of Tutankhamun etc. .
Artists and designers integrated motifs from ancient Egypt , Mesopotamia , Greece , Rome , Asia , Mesoamerica , and Oceania with Machine Age elements .
Deco was also influenced by Cubism , Constructivism , Functionalism , Modernism , and Futurism .
Grasset stresses the principle that various simple geometric shapes ( e.g. , the triangle , the square ) are the basis of all compositional arrangements .
At the 1907 Salon d'Automne ( Paris ) Georges Braque exhibited Viaduc à l'Estaque ( a proto-Cubist work ) , now at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts .
Simultaneously , there was a retrospective exhibition of 56 works by Paul Cézanne , as a tribute to the artist who died in 1906 .
Cézanne was interested in the simplification of forms to their geometric essentials : the cylinder , the sphere , the cone .
Paul Iribe created for the couturier Paul Poiret esthetic designs that shocked the Parisian milieu with its novelty .
These illustrations were compiled into an album , Les Robes de Paul Poiret racontée par Paul Iribe , published in 1908 .
Several months later the Salon d'Automne saw the invitation of Munich artists who for several years had been working with simple geometric shapes .
The rigorous composition of its facade , designed by Auguste Perret , is a major example of early Art Deco .
The artists of the Section d'Or exhibited ( in 1912 ) works considerably more accessible to the general public than the analytical cubism of Picasso and Braque .
The Cubist vocabulary was poised to attract fashion designers , furniture and interior designers .
These revolutionary changes occurring at the outset of the 20th century are summarized in the 1912 writings of André Vera .
Order , color and geometry : the essence of Art Deco vocabulary was made manifest before 1914 .
Laurens designed the fountain , Csaky designed Doucet 's staircase , Lipchitz made the fireplace mantel , Marcoussis made a Cubist rug .
It was an early example of L'art décoratif , a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern , bourgeois life .
Spectators at the Salon d'Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade .
Attributes Deco emphasizes geometric forms : spheres , polygons , rectangles , trapezoids , zigzags , chevrons , and sunburst motifs .
Elements are often arranged in symmetrical patterns .
Modern materials such as aluminum , stainless steel , Bakelite , chrome , and plastic s are frequently used .
Stained glass , inlay s , and lacquer are also common .
Colors tend to be vivid and high-contrast .
Influence Art Deco was a globally popular style and affected many areas of design .
It also influenced architecture , interior design , industrial design , fashion , graphic arts , and cinema .
A resurgence of interest began during the 1960s .
Deco continues to inspire designers and is often used in contemporary fashion , jewelry , and toiletries .
Streamline Moderne A style related to Art Deco is Streamline Moderne ( or Streamline ) which emerged during the 1930s .
Streamline was influenced by modern aerodynamic principles developed for aviation and ballistics to reduce air friction at high velocities .
Designers applied these principles to cars , trains , ships , and even objects not intended to move such as refrigerator s , gas pumps , and buildings .
One of the first production vehicles in this style was the Chrysler Airflow of 1933 .
It was unsuccessful commercially but the beauty and functionality of its design set a precedent .
Streamlining quickly influenced automotive design and evolved the rectangular " horseless carriage " into sleek vehicles with aerodynamic lines , symmetry , and V-shapes .
These designs continued to be popular after World War II .

The term is also loosely used to refer to text based visual art in general .
Studies in Perception I " by Ken Knowlton and Leon Harmon from 1966 shows some examples of their early ASCII art .
One of the main reasons ASCII art was born was because early printers often lacked graphics ability and thus characters were used in place of graphic marks .
ASCII art was also used in early e-mail when images could not be embedded .
History Typewriter art Since 1867 typewriters have been used for creating visual art .
The oldest known preserved example of typewriter art is a picture of a butterfly made in 1898 by Flora Stacey .
Typewriter art was also called keyboard art .
In the 1954 short film Stamp Day for Superman , typewriter art was a feature of the plot .
TTY and RTTY TTY stands for " TeleTYpe " or " TeleTYpewriter " and is also known as Teleprinter or Teletype .
RTTY stands for Radioteletype ; character set s such as Baudot code , which predated ASCII , were used .
According to a chapter in the " RTTY Handbook " , text images have been sent via teletypewriter as early as 1923 .
However , none of the " old " RTTY art has been discovered yet .
What is known is that text images appeared frequently on radioteletype in the 1960s and the 1970s .
ASCII art The widespread usage of ASCII art can be traced to the computer bulletin board system s of the late 1970s and early 1980s .
The limitations of computers of that time period necessitated the use of text characters to represent images .
Along with ASCII 's use in communication , however , it also began to appear in the underground online art groups of the period .
An ASCII comic is a form of webcomic which uses ASCII text to create images .
In place of images in a regular comic , ASCII art is used , with the text or dialog usually placed underneath .
During the 1990s , graphical browsing and variable-width fonts became increasingly popular , leading to a decline in ASCII art .
Over the years , warez groups began to enter the ASCII art scene .
Warez groups usually release . nfo files with their software , cracks or other general software reverse-engineering releases .
The ASCII art will usually include the warez group 's name and maybe some ASCII borders on the outsides of the release notes , etc. .
BBS systems were based on ASCII and ANSI art , as were most DOS and similar console applications , and the procursor to AOL .
ASCII art is also used within the source code of computer programs for representation of company or product logos , and flow control or other diagrams .
Examples of ASCII-style art predating the modern computer era can be found in the June 1939 , July 1948 and October 1948 editions of Popular Mechanics . "

The emergence of ATASCII art coincided with the growing popularity of BBS Systems caused by availability of the acoustic coupler s that were compatible with the 8-bit home computers .
ATASCII text animations are also referred to as " break animations " by the Atari sceners .

The C-64 character set is called PETSCII , an extended form of ASCII -1963 .
As with the Atari 's ATASCII art , C-64 fans developed a similar scene that used PETSCII for their creations .
Block ASCIIs " were widely used on the PC during the 1990s until the Internet replaced BBSes as the main communication platform .
Until then , " block ASCIIs " dominated the PC Text Art Scene .
Some members left in 1990 , and formed a group called ACiD , " ANSI Creators in Demand . "
In that same year the second major underground art scene group was founded , ICE , " Insane Creators Enterprise " .
Microsoft Windows does not support the ANSI Standard x3 .16 .
One can view block ASCIIs with a text editor using the font " Terminal " , but it will not look exactly as it was intended by the artist .
Alternatively , one could look at the file using the Type command in the command prompt .

It is also called " Amiga style " , due to its origin and widespread use on the Commodore Amiga Computers .
The style uses primarily the characters : _ / \ - + = .
The " oldskool " art looks more like the outlined drawings of shapes than real pictures .
This is an example of " Amiga style " ( also referred to as " old school " or " oldskool " style ) scene ASCII art .
The Amiga ASCII Scene surfaced in 1992 , 7 years after the introduction of the Commodore Amiga 1000 .
The Commodore 64 PETSCII scene did not make the transition to the Commodore Amiga as the C64 demo and warez scenes did .
Among the first Amiga ASCII art groups were ART , Epsilon Design , Upper Class , Unreal .
This means that the text art scene on the Amiga was actually younger than the text art scene on the PC .
The Amiga artists also did not call their ASCII art style " Oldskool " .
That term was introduced on the PC .
When and by whom is unknown and lost in history .
Furthermore , the releases were usually called " ASCII collections " and not " art packs " like on the IBM PC .
Popular editors used to make this kind of ASCII art include CygnusEd itor aka CED ( Amiga ) and EditPlus 2 ( PC ) .

It was dubbed " Newskool " upon its comeback and renewed popularity at the end of the 1990s .
Newskool changed significantly as the result of the introduction of extended proprietary characters .
The classic 7-bit standard ASCII characters remain predominant , but the extended characters are often used for " fine tuning " and " tweaking " .
The style developed further after the introduction and adaptation of Unicode .
For Block ASCII art and ANSI art the artist almost always uses a special text editor , because the required characters are not available on a standard keyboard .
The special text editors have sets of special characters assigned to existing keys on the keyboard .
PabloDraw is one of the very few special ASCII/ANSI art editors that were developed for MS Windows XP .
A method is to sample the image down to grayscale with less than 8-bit precision , and then assign a character for each value .
Such ASCII art generators often allow users to choose the intensity and contrast of the generated image .
Examples of converted images are given below .
With the advent of the web and HTML and CSS , many ASCII conversion programs will now quantize to a full RGB colorspace , enabling colorized ASCII images .

There are also a number of smartphone applications , such as ASCII cam for Android , that generate ASCII art in real-time using input from the phone 's camera .
These applications typically allow the ASCII art to be saved as either a text file or as an image made up of ASCII text .
Early computers in use when ASCII art came into vogue had monospace fonts for screen and printer displays .
ASCII art drawn for a fixed width font will usually appear distorted , or even unrecognizable when displayed in a proportional font .
Some ASCII artists have produced art for display in proportional fonts .
These ASCIIs , rather than using a purely shade-based correspondence , use characters for slopes and borders and use block shading .
= = Animated ASCII art = = Animated ASCII art started in 1970 from so-called VT100 animations produced on vt100 terminals .
These animations were simply text with cursor movement instructions , deleting and erasing the characters necessary to appear animated .
Usually , they represented a long hand-crafted process undertaken by a single person to tell a story .
Contemporary web browser revitalized animated ASCII art again .
It became possible to display animated ASCII art via JavaScript or Java applets .
A new term was born : '' ASCIImation '' – another name of Animated ASCII Art .
A seminal work in this arena is the Star Wars ASCIImation .
There are now many tools and programs that can transform raster images into text symbols ; some of these tools can operate on streaming video .
For example , the music video for pop singer Beck Hansen 's song " Black Tambourine " is made up entirely of ASCII characters that approximate the original footage .
Despite not being pure ASCII , these are still often referred to as " ASCII art " .

SYS , if loaded , also allows such art to be placed on screen by outputting escape sequences that indicate movements of the screen cursor and color/flash changes .
If this method is used then the art becomes known as ANSI art .
The IBM PC code pages also include characters intended for simple drawing which often made this art appear much cleaner than that made with more traditional character sets .

American English is a set of dialect s of the English language used mostly in the United States .
Approximately two-thirds of the world 's native speakers of English live in the United States .
English is the most common language in the United States .
English has been given official status by 30 of the 50 state governments .
As an example , under federal law , English is the official language of United States courts in Puerto Rico .
The use of English in the United States is a result of English colonization .
The first wave of English-speaking settlers arrived in North America during the 17th century , followed by further migrations in the 18th and 19th centuries .
Phonology Compared with English as spoken in England , North American English is more homogeneous .
Most North American speech is rhotic , as English was in most places in the 17th century .
Rhoticity was further supported by Hiberno-English , West Country English and Scottish English as well as the fact most regions of England at this time also had rhotic accents .
In most varieties of North American English , the sound corresponding to the letter r is an alveolar approximant or retroflex rather than a trill or a tap .
Dropping of syllable-final r sometimes happens in natively rhotic dialects if r is located in unaccented syllables or words and the next syllable or word begins in a consonant .
This does not happen in the non-rhotic varieties of North American speech .
Several thousand are now used in English as spoken internationally .
Examples of such names are opossum , raccoon , squash and moose ( from Algonquian ) .
Other Native American loanwords , such as wigwam or moccasin , describe articles in common use among Native Americans .
Already existing words such as creek , slough , sleet and ( in later use ) watershed received new meanings that were unknown in England .
The word blizzard probably originated in the West .
A couple of notable late 18th century additions are the verb belittle and the noun bid , both first used in writing by Thomas Jefferson .
Some of these are internationally used ( for example , caucus , gerrymander , filibuster , exit poll ) .
Such constructions as Are you coming with ?
and I like to dance ( for " I like dancing " ) may also be the result of German or Yiddish influence .
Some English words now in general use , such as hijacking , disc jockey , boost , bulldoze and jazz , originated as American slang .
, it ai n't over till it 's over , what goes around comes around , and will the real x please stand up ?
Morphology American English has always shown a marked tendency to use nouns as verbs .
American blend s include motel , guesstimate , infomercial and televangelist .
During the 17th century , English immigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak and the new settlers took the English language with them .
While the term fall gradually became obsolete in Britain , it became the more common term in North America .
Some of these , for example monkey wrench and wastebasket , originated in 19th-century Britain .
It appears in some areas as a spoken usage and is considered obligatory in contexts that are more formal .
Regional differences While written American English is standardized across the country , there are several recognizable variations in the spoken language , both in pronunciation and in vernacular vocabulary .
General American is the name given to any American accent that is relatively free of noticeable regional influences .
In parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio , another dialect known as Pennsylvania Dutch English is also spoken .
Interior In the interior , the situation is very different .
West of the Appalachian Mountains begins the broad zone of what is generally called " Midland " speech .
The island state of Hawaii has a distinctive Hawaiian Pidgin .
Differences in orthography are also trivial .
Biography Having played baseball throughout his youth , Spalding first played competitively with the Rockford Pioneers , a youth team , which he joined in 1865 .
To aid him in this venture , Hulbert enlisted the help of Spalding .
Spalding then coaxed teammates Deacon White , Ross Barnes and Cal McVey , as well as Philadelphia Athletics players Cap Anson and Bob Addy , to sign with Chicago .
Joining Chicago initially were the leading teams from Cincinnati , Louisville , and Indianapolis .
The owners of these western clubs accompanied Hulbert and Spalding to New York where they secretly met with owners from New York , Philadelphia , Hartford , and Boston .
Each signed the league 's constitution , and the National League was officially born .
Although the National Association held on for a few more seasons , it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball .
Gradually , it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country .
Meanwhile , Spalding and his brother began a sporting goods store in Chicago .
In 1877 , Spalding began to use a glove to protect his catching hand .
People had used gloves previously , but never had a star like Spalding used one .
Of course , Spalding had an ulterior motive for doing so .
He and his brother sold baseball gloves , and wearing one himself was good for business .
In 1876 , Spalding won 47 games as the prime pitcher for the Chicago White Stockings , who captured the National League 's inaugural pennant by a wide margin .
Spalding published the first official rules guide for baseball .
In it he stated that only Spalding balls could be used ( previously , the quality of the balls used had been subpar ) .
Spalding also founded the " Baseball Guide , " which at the time was the most widely-read baseball publication .
Spalding retired from playing baseball in 1878 , although he continued as a major force as owner of the White Stockings and major influence on the National League .
Spalding 's .796 career winning percentage ( from an era when teams played about once or twice a week ) is the highest ever achieved by a baseball pitcher .
In 1888 – 1889 , Spalding took a group of major league players around the world to promote baseball and Spalding sporting goods .
The tour returned to grand receptions in New York , Philadelphia , and Chicago .
The tour included future Hall of Fame rs Cap Anson and John Montgomery Ward .
The league lasted one year , partially due to the anti-competitive tactics of Spalding to limit its success .
In 1900 Spalding was appointed by President McKinley as the USA 's Commissioner at that year 's Summer Olympic Games .
The commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters .
After three years of searching , on December 30 , 1907 , Spalding received a letter that ( erroneously ) declared baseball to be the invention of Abner Doubleday .
He built an estate in the Sunset Cliffs area of Point Loma where he lived for the rest of his life .
Death He died on September 9 , 1915 in San Diego , and was cremated .
His nephew , also named Albert Spalding , was a renowned violin ist .
The Africa Alphabet ( also International African Alphabet or IAI alphabet ) was developed in 1928 under the lead of Diedrich Westermann .
He developed it with a group of Africanists at the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures ( later the IAI ) in London .
The African Alphabet was used , with the International Phonetic Alphabet , as a basis for the World Orthography .

Acquire is a board game designed by Sid Sackson .
The game was originally published in 1962 by 3M as a part of their bookshelf games series .
In most versions , the theme of the game is investing in hotel chains .
In the 1990s Hasbro edition , the hotel chains were replaced by generic corporations , though the actual gameplay was unchanged .
The game is currently published by Hasbro under the Avalon Hill brand , and the companies are once again hotel chains .
The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains .
When a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain , players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain .
At the end of the game , all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money .
Components The components of the game have varied over the years .
In particular , the tiles have been made from wood , plastic , and cardboard in various editions of the game .
In the current 2008 version , the tiles are cardboard .
The 108 tiles correspond to each of the squares : 5E , 10B , and so forth .
Rules Acquire is a game for three to six players , though earlier editions included special rules for two players .
Standard tournament games are played with four players .
Setup At the beginning of the game , each player receives $ 6000 in cash .
Each player draws a tile and places it on the board .
The player whose tile is in the topmost row ( closest to row A ) goes first .
If more than one player selects a tile in that row , then the player whose tile is in the leftmost column ( closest to 1 ) goes first .
All players place these tiles on the board .
Then , starting with the first player , each player draws six tiles .
Play of the game A turn consists of three steps : Tile placement falls in one of four categories .
The tile placed could be an orphan , adjacent to no other tile on the board .
The tile could create a new chain of tiles , and the player who placed it on the board would have the opportunity to found a new chain .
The tile could increase the length of an existing chain already on the board .
Or the tile could link two chains , causing a merger of two or more chains .
Since there are only seven hotel chains in the game , placing a tile that would create an eighth chain is not permitted .
When a player founds a chain , he receives one free share of stock in that chain .
If , however , there are no shares left when the chain is founded , then the founding player does not receive the free share .
After a player places a tile , and the results of that placement have been handled , he may purchase up to three shares of stock .
A player may only purchase shares of stock in chains that have already been founded .
The price of a share depends on the size of the chain , according to a chart that lists prices according to size .
Finally , the player replaces the tile he played , ensuring that he has six tiles at the end of his turn .
Growing and merging chains A chain is a conglomeration of tiles that are linked to each other either horizontally or vertically but not diagonally .
For example , adjacent to square 5F are squares 4F , 6F , 5E , and 5G , but not 6E or 4G .
If there is a tile in 5F , then placing either tile 4F or 5G would result in founding a new hotel chain .
A chain grows when a player increases the length of a chain .
Suppose a chain consists of squares 8D , 8E , and 8F .
Playing tile 9F would add to the length of the chain .
Playing tile 9E would not .
Chains merge when a player places the tile that eliminates the empty space between them .
Suppose there is a chain at 1A , 2A , 3A , and 4A , along with another chain at 6A and 7A .
Placing tile 5A would cause these two chains to merge .
When a merger occurs , the larger hotel chain always acquires the smaller hotel chain .
Mergers The merger is the mechanism by which the players compete .
Mergers yield bonuses for the two shareholders who hold , respectively , the largest and second-largest interests in a chain .
Rules issues The rules allow any player to count the number of shares available in the bank .
However , the rules do not specify whether a player should hold his shares of stock face up or face down .
That is , the rules do not say whether one player may ask another how many shares of stock he or she owns in a particular chain .
Whether this is public or private information should be agreed upon between players before the game begins .
The current rules do not provide for a two-player game .
However , the stock market was used as a " third shareholder " in previous versions of the game .
By this rule , a tile is drawn whenever a merger is declared .
The number on the tile indicates how many shares the stock market owns in the company that is being acquired .
The players must compete with the market as well as with each other in order to receive bonuses .
Upon declaring the game over , the player is allowed to complete his turn ( including buying stock ) .
Ending the game is optional - if he believes it is to his advantage not to end the game , he may refrain from doing so .
Corner Cases These conditions can be used to handle unusual situations .
Awards The game was short-listed for the first Spiel des Jahres board game awards in 1979 .
GAMES magazine has inducted Acquire into their buyers ' guide Hall of Fame .
It was inducted into the Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts & Design 's Hall of Fame , along with Sackson , in 2011 .

Australian English ( AusE , AuE , AusEng , en-AU ) is a major variety of the English language and is used throughout Australia .
Australian English differs from other varieties of English in vocabulary , accent , pronunciation , register , grammar and spelling .
History The earliest form of Australian English was first spoken by the children of the colonists born into the colony of New South Wales .
This very first generation of children created a new dialect that was to become the language of the nation .
Even when new settlers arrived , this new dialect was strong enough to deflect the influence of other patterns of speech .
A large part of the convict body were the Irish , 25 % of the total convict population .
Many of these people were arrested in Ireland , and some in Great Britain .
It is possible that the majority of Irish convicts either did not speak English , or spoke English " indifferently " .
There were other significant populations of convicts from non-English speaking areas of Britain , such as the Scottish Highlands and Wales .
Anthony Burgess writes that " Australian English may be thought of as a kind of fossilised Cockney of the Dickensian era . "
According to linguist Bruce Moore , " the major input of the various sounds that went into constructing the Australian accent was from south-east England . "
Some elements of Aboriginal languages have been adopted by Australian English — mainly as names for places , flora and fauna ( for example dingo ) and local culture .
Other examples are cooee and hard yakka .
The former is used as a high-pitched call , for attracting attention , ( pronounced ) which travels long distances .
Cooee is also a notional distance : if he 's within cooee , we 'll spot him .
Hard yakka means hard work and is derived from yakka , from the Jagera / Yagara language once spoken in the Brisbane region .
Many towns or suburbs of Australia have also been influenced or named after Aboriginal words .
The most well known example is the capital , Canberra named after a local language word meaning " meeting place " .
Among the changes starting in the 19th-century gold rushes was the introduction of words , spellings , terms and usages from North American English .
The words imported included some later considered to be typically Australian , such as bonzer .
Phonology and Pronunciation The primary way in which Australian English is distinctive from other varieties of English is through its unique pronunciation .
It shares most similarity with other Southern Hemisphere accents , in particular New Zealand English .
Like most dialects of English it is distinguished primarily by its vowel phonology .
Vowels The vowels of Australian English can be divided according to length .
The short vowels , consisting only of monophthongs , correspond to the RP lax vowels .
Consonants There is little variation with respect to the sets of consonant s used in various English dialects .
There are , however , variations in how these consonants are used .
Australian English is no exception .
Australian English is non-rhotic ; in other words , the sound does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant .
However , a linking can occur when a word that has a final in the spelling comes before another word that starts with a vowel .
For some speakers in final or in medial position is glottalised to [ [ glottal stop | ] ] .
The wine – whine merger is complete in Australian English .
'' Yod '' - dropping occurs after , , , , , , , and , .
Other cases of and , along with and , have coalesced to , , and respectively for many speakers .
In addition , miscellaneous pronunciation differences exist when compared with other varieties of English in relation to seemingly random words .
Despite this , '' advertisement '' is pronounced with / ɪ / . ''
Brooch '' is pronounced with / əʉ / as opposed to / ʉː / , and '' Anthony '' with / θ / rather than / t / .
= = Variation = = Academic research has shown that the most notable variation within Australian English is largely sociocultural .
This is mostly evident in phonology , which is divided into three sociocultural varieties : '' broad '' , '' general '' and '' cultivated '' .
A limited range of word choice s is strongly region al in nature .
In addition , some Australians speak creole languages derived from Australian English , such as Australian Kriol , Torres Strait Creole and Norfuk .
They can reflect the social class , education and urban or rural background of speakers , though such indicators are not always reliable .
According to linguists , the general Australian variant emerged some time before 1900 .
Recent generations have seen a comparatively smaller proportion of the population speaking with the broad variant , along with the near extinction of the cultivated Australian accent .
The growth and dominance of general Australian accents perhaps reflects its prominence on radio and television during the late 20th century .
There are distinctive features of accent , grammar , words and meanings , as well as language use .
The ethnocultural dialects are diverse accents in Australian English that are spoken by the minority groups , which are of non-English speaking background .
A massive immigration from Asia has made a large increase in diversity and the will for people to show their cultural identity within the Australian context .
= = = Regional variation = = = Although Australian English is relatively homogeneous , some regional variations are notable .
The dialects of English spoken in South Australia , Western Australia , New South Wales , Victoria , Queensland and the Torres Strait islands differ slightly from each other .
Differences in terms of vocabulary and phonology exist .
Most regional differences come down to word usage .
Preference for synonymous words also differs between states .
Beer glasses are also named differently in different states .
Distinctive grammatical patterns exist such as the use of the interrogative '' eh ? '' .
There are some notable regional variations in the pronunciations of certain words .
The extent to which the trap‑bath split has taken hold is one example .
This phonological development is more advanced in South Australia , which had a different settlement chronology and type than other parts of the country .
'' L' ' - vocalisation is also more common in South Australia than other states .
A feature common in Victorian English is salary – celery merger .
There is also regional variation in before .
= = Vocabulary = = [ [ Image : Banjo Patterson .
Dinkum '' , or '' fair dinkum '' means " true " , or " is that true ? "
, among other things , depending on context and inflection .
The derivative '' dinky-di '' means ' true ' or devoted : a ' dinky-di Aussie ' is a ' true Australian ' .
Australian English , in common with several British English dialects ( for example , Cockney , Scouse , Glaswegian and Geordie ) , uses the word '' mate '' .
Many words used by Australians were at one time used in England but have since fallen out of usage or changed in meaning there .
This may also be done with people 's names to create nickname s ( other English speaking countries create similar diminutives ) .
For example , " Gazza " from Gary , or " Smitty " from John Smith .
In informal speech , incomplete comparisons are sometimes used , such as " sweet as " ( as in " That car is sweet as . " ) . "
This was more common in regional Australia and South Australia but has been in common usage in urban Australia for decades .
The suffix " - ly " is sometimes omitted in broader Australian English .
For instance " real good " instead of " really good " .
Australia 's switch to the metric system in the 1970s changed the country 's vocabulary of measurement from Imperial towards metric measures .
In addition , a number of words in Australian English have different meanings to those ascribed in other varieties of English .
Clothing-related examples are notable . ''
Also stigmatised in British English but acceptable in Australian English is '' snuck '' as the past tense of sneak . ''
However Australians , like Americans , are more likely to pronounce numbers such as 1200 as '' twelve hundred '' , rather than '' one thousand two hundred '' .
= = Spelling , Style and Keyboards = = As in most English-speaking countries , there is no official governmental regulator or overseer of correct spelling and grammar .
The '' Macquarie Dictionary '' is used by universities and other organisations as a standard for Australian English spelling .
Australian spelling is closer to British than American spelling .
Australian print media , including digital media , today strongly favour '' - our '' endings .
Okay " , rather than " OK " , is listed as the preferred variant .
Different spellings have existed throughout Australia 's history .
This influence can be seen in the spelling of the Australian Labor Party and also in some place names such as Victor Harbor .
The '' Concise Oxford English Dictionary '' has been attributed with re-establishing the dominance of the British spellings in the 1920s and 1930s .
Many general interest paperbacks were printed in SR1 .
Spaced and unspaced em-dashes remain in mainstream use , as with American and Canadian English .
There are two major English language keyboard layouts , the United States layout and the United Kingdom layout .
Australia universally uses the United States keyboard .
American Airlines Flight 77 was a passenger flight which was hijacked by five al-Qaeda terrorists on September 11 , 2001 , as part of the September 11 attacks .
Less than 35 minutes into the flight , the hijackers stormed the cockpit .
They forced the passengers , crew , and pilots to the rear of the aircraft .
Hani Hanjour , one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot , assumed control of the flight .
Unknown to the hijackers , passengers aboard made telephone calls to loved ones and relayed information on the hijacking .
The hijackers crashed the aircraft into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 EDT .
Dozens of people witnessed the crash , and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes .
The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire .
At 10:10 AM , a portion of the Pentagon collapsed ; firefighters spent days trying to fully extinguish the blaze .
The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002 , with occupants moving back into the completed areas on August 15 , 2002 .
The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the Pentagon Memorial adjacent to the Pentagon .
Hijackers The hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77 were led by Hani Hanjour , who piloted the aircraft into the Pentagon .
Hanjour first came to the United States in 1990 .
Hanjour trained at the CRM Airline Training Center in Scottsdale , Arizona , earning his FAA commercial pilot 's certificate in April 1999 .
He had wanted to be a commercial pilot for the Saudi national airline but was rejected when he applied to the civil aviation school in Jeddah in 1999 .
Hanjour likely went to Afghanistan , where Al Qaeda recruits were screened for special skills they may have .
Already having selected the Hamburg Cell members , Al Qaeda leaders selected Hanjour to lead the fourth team of hijackers .
Two FBI agents inside the unit tried to alert FBI headquarters , but CIA officers rebuffed them .
In December 2000 , Hanjour arrived in San Diego , joining " muscle " hijackers Nawaf al-Hazmi and Khalid al-Mihdhar , who had been there since January 2000 .
Soon after arriving , Hanjour and Hazmi left for Mesa , Arizona , where Hanjour began refresher training at Arizona Aviation .
In April 2001 , they relocated to Falls Church , Virginia , where they awaited the arrival of the remaining " muscle " hijackers .
They moved into an apartment with Hazmi and Hanjour .
While living in Falls Church , Hazmi attended the mosque in the community .
On May 21 , 2001 , Hanjour rented a room in Paterson , New Jersey , where he stayed with other hijackers through the end of August .
They stayed with Hanjour .
Hanjour received ground instruction and did practice flights at Air Fleet Training Systems in Teterboro , New Jersey , and at Caldwell Flight Academy in Fairfield , New Jersey .
Hanjour moved out of the room in Paterson and arrived at the Valencia Motel in Laurel , Maryland , on September 2 , 2001 .
While in Maryland , Hanjour and fellow hijackers trained at Gold 's Gym in Greenbelt .
On September 10 , he completed a certification flight , using a terrain recognition system for navigation , at Congressional Air Charters in Gaithersburg , Maryland .
On September 10 , Nawaf al-Hazmi , accompanied by other hijackers , checked into the Marriott in Herndon , Virginia near Dulles Airport .
Suspected accomplices According to a U.S. State Department cable leaked in the Wikileaks dump in February 2010 , the FBI has investigated another suspect , Mohammed al-Mansoori .
An official added that the three Qatari citizens have never been questioned by the FBI .
She also said that the inquiry concluded that the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways .
Instead , they flew from Los Angeles to Qatar , via Washington and London .
Flight The American Airlines Flight 77 aircraft was a Boeing 757-223 ( registration number N644AA ) .
The flight crew included pilot Charles Burlingame , First Officer David Charlebois , and flight attendants Michele Heidenberger , Jennifer Lewis , Kenneth Lewis , and Renee May .
The capacity of the aircraft was 188 passengers , but with 58 passengers on September 11 , the load factor was 33 percent .
American Airlines said that Tuesdays were the least-traveled day of the week , with the same load factor seen on Tuesdays in the previous three months for Flight 77 .
Boarding and departure On the morning of September 11 , 2001 , the five hijackers arrived at Washington , D.C. 's Dulles International Airport .
Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening .
Moqed continued to set off the alarm , so he was searched with a hand wand .
The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29 .
Hani Hanjour checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35 .
Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi , who also set off the metal detector 's alarm .
The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm .
As seen in security footage later released , Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket .
Utility knives up to four inches were permitted at the time by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) as carry-on items .
The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by Argenbright Security , under contract with United Airlines .
The hijackers were all selected for extra screening of their checked bags .
Hanjour , Mihdhar , and Nawaf al-Hazmi did not check any bags for the flight .
Checked bags belonging to Moqed and Salem al-Hazmi were held until they boarded the aircraft .
By 07:50 , the five hijackers , carrying knives and box cutters , had made it through the airport security checkpoint .
Flight 77 was scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at 08:10 ; 58 passengers boarded through Gate D26 , including the five hijackers .
On the flight , Hani Hanjour was seated up front in 1B , while Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi were seated in first class in seats 5E and 5F .
Majed Moqed and Khalid al-Mihdhar were seated further back in 12A and 12B , in economy class .
Flight 77 left the gate on time and took off from Runway 30 at Dulles at .
The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to air traffic control occurred at 08:50:51 .
Unlike the other three flights , there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat .
At 08:54 , the plane began to deviate from its normal , assigned flight path and turned south .
The hijackers set the flight 's autopilot heading for Washington , D.C. By 08:56 , the flight was turned around , and the transponder had been disabled .
The FAA was aware at this point that there was an emergency on board the airplane .
The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center , as well as American Airlines dispatchers , made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft .
At the time the airplane was hijacked , it was flying over an area of limited radar coverage .
With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio , an Indianapolis official declared that the Boeing 757 had possibly crashed at 09:09 .
Two people on the aircraft made phone calls to contacts on the ground .
At 09:12 , flight attendant Renee May called her mother , Nancy May , in Las Vegas .
May asked her mother to contact American Airlines , which she and her husband promptly did ; American Airlines was already aware of the hijacking .
She reported that the passengers , including the pilots , had been moved to the back of the cabin and that the hijackers were unaware of her call .
A minute into the conversation , the call was cut off .
Theodore Olson contacted the command center at the Department of Justice , and tried unsuccessfully to contact Attorney General John Ashcroft .
Ted Olson asked her location and she reported the plane was flying over a residential area .
He told her of the attacks on the World Trade Center .
Soon afterward , the call cut off again .
An airplane was detected again by Dulles controllers on radar screens as it approached Washington , turning and descending rapidly .
Controllers initially thought this was a military fighter , due to its high speed and maneuvering .
Reagan Airport controllers asked a passing Air National Guard Lockheed C-130 Hercules to identify and follow the aircraft .
Crash According to the 9/11 Commission Report , as Flight 77 was west-southwest of the Pentagon , it made a 330-degree turn .
At the end of the turn , it was descending through , pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington .
Hani Hanjour advanced the throttles to maximum power and dived toward the Pentagon .
At the time of the attacks , approximately 18,000 people worked in the Pentagon , which was 4,000 fewer than before renovations began in 1998 .
The crash and subsequent fire penetrated three outer ring sections of the western side .
The outermost ring section was largely destroyed , and a large section collapsed .
One hundred and twenty-five people in the Pentagon died in the attack .
In all , there were 189 deaths at the Pentagon site , including the 125 in the Pentagon building in addition to the 64 on board the aircraft .
Passenger Barbara Olson was en route to a taping of Politically Incorrect .
The Army suffered 75 fatalities — far more than any other branch .
Another 106 injured were treated at area hospitals .
On the side where the plane hit , the Pentagon is bordered by Interstate 395 and Washington Boulevard .
Omar Campo , another witness , was cutting the grass on the other side of the road when the airplane flew over his head . "
I was cutting the grass and it came in screaming over my head .
I felt the impact .
The whole ground shook and the whole area was full of fire .
I could never imagine I would see anything like that here " .
Afework Hagos , a computer programmer , was on his way to work and stuck in a traffic jam near the Pentagon when the airplane flew over . "
There was a huge screaming noise and I got out of the car as the plane came over .
Everybody was running away in different directions .
It was tilting its wings up and down like it was trying to balance .
It hit some lampposts on the way in . "
Daryl Donley witnessed the crash and took some of the first photographs of the site .
And I thought , ' This does n't add up , it 's really low . '
And I saw it .
I mean it was like a cruise missile with wings .
It went right there and slammed right into the Pentagon " .
He watched " it just plow right into the side of the Pentagon .
The nose penetrated into the portico .
And then it sort of disappeared , and there was fire and smoke everywhere . "
Tim Timmerman , who is a pilot himself , noticed American Airlines markings on the aircraft as he saw it hit the Pentagon .
Former Georgetown University basketball coach John Thompson had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77 .
However , this did not work for the show , which wanted him to travel on the day of the show .
He felt the impact from the crash at his home near the Pentagon .
Rescue and recovery Rescue efforts began immediately after the crash .
Almost all the successful rescues of survivors occurred within half an hour of the impact .
Initially , rescue efforts were led by the military and civilian employees within the building .
Within minutes , the first fire companies arrived and found these volunteers searching near the impact site .
The firemen ordered them to leave as they were not properly equipped or trained to deal with the hazards .
The Arlington County Fire Department ( ACFD ) assumed command of the immediate rescue operation within 10 minutes of the crash .
ACFD Assistant Chief James Schwartz implemented an incident command system ( ICS ) to coordinate response efforts among multiple agencies .
It took about an hour for the ICS structure to become fully operational .
Firefighters from Fort Myer and Reagan National Airport arrived within minutes .
Rescue and firefighting efforts were impeded by rumors of additional incoming planes .
Chief Schwartz ordered two evacuations during the day in response to these rumors .
As firefighters attempted to extinguish the fires , they watched the building in fear of a structural collapse .
One firefighter remarked that they " pretty much knew the building was going to collapse because it started making weird sounds and creaking " .
Officials saw a cornice of the building move and ordered an evacuation .
Minutes later , at 10:10 , the upper floors of the damaged area of the Pentagon collapsed .
The collapse area was about at its widest point and at its deepest .
The amount of time between impact and collapse allowed everyone on the fourth and fifth levels to evacuate safely before the structure collapsed .
After the collapse , the interior fires intensified , spreading through all five floors .
After 11:00 , firefighters mounted a two-pronged attack against the fires .
Officials estimated temperatures of up to .
Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it .
Firefighters instead made firebreak s in the roof on September 12 to prevent further spreading .
At 18:00 on the 12th , Arlington County issued a press release stating the fire was " controlled " but not fully " extinguished " .
Firefighters continued to put out smaller fires that ignited in the succeeding days .
Various pieces of aircraft debris were found within the wreckage at the Pentagon .
The cockpit voice recorder was too badly damaged and charred to retrieve any information , though the flight data recorder yielded useful information .
Investigators also found a part of Nawaf al-Hazmi 's driver 's license in the North Parking Lot rubble pile .
Personal effects belonging to victims were found and taken to Fort Myer .
Remains Army engineers determined by 5:30 p.m. on the first day that no one remained alive in the damaged section of the building .
In the days after the crash , news reports emerged that up to 800 people had died .
Army troops from Fort Belvoir were the first teams to survey the interior of the crash site and noted the presence of human remains .
Debris from the Pentagon were taken to the Pentagon 's north parking lot for more detailed search for remains and evidence .
Remains that were recovered from the Pentagon were photographed , and turned over to the Armed Forces Medical Examiner office , located at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware .
The medical examiner 's office was able to identify remains belonging to 179 of the victims .
Investigators eventually identified 184 of the 189 people who died in the attack .
The remains of the five hijackers were identified through a process of elimination , and were turned over as evidence to the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) .
On September 21 , the ACFD relinquished control of the crime scene to the FBI .
By October 2 , 2001 , the search for evidence and remains was complete and the site was turned over to Pentagon officials .
The ceremony also honored the five victims whose remains were never found .
They called for an FBI agent , who in turn called for someone from the National Transportation Safety Board ( NTSB ) .
The NTSB employee confirmed that these were the flight recorders ( " black boxes " ) from American Airlines Flight 77 .
Dick Bridges , deputy manager for Arlington County , Virginia , said the voice recorder was damaged on the outside and the flight data recorder was charred .
But he said the FBI still was confident the data could be recovered from both .
Bridges said the recorders were found " right where the plane came into the building . "
The cockpit voice recorder was quickly transported to the NTSB lab in Washington , D.C. , and its data was downloaded .
Soon afterward , the FBI took charge of the box and its data .
CBS News reported that " Preliminary information shows there is nothing that appears to be useful on the cockpit voice tape .
The tape appears to be blank or erased . "
The NTSB reported that " The majority of the recording tape was fused into a solid block of charred plastic . "
No usable segments of tape were found inside the recorder .
He ran to the site and assisted the injured .
On the day of the attacks , DOD officials considered moving their command operations to Site R , a backup facility in Pennsylvania .
Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air .
During a press conference held inside the Pentagon at 18:42 , Rumsfeld announced , " The Pentagon 's functioning .
It will be in business tomorrow . "
Pentagon employees returned the next day to offices in mostly unaffected areas of the building .
By the end of September , more workers returned to the lightly damaged areas of the Pentagon .
Aftermath Early estimates on rebuilding the damaged section of the Pentagon were that it would take three years to complete .
However , the project moved forward at an accelerated pace and was completed by the one-year anniversary of the attack .
The rebuilt section of the Pentagon includes a small indoor memorial and chapel at the point of impact .
An outdoor memorial , commissioned by the Pentagon and designed by Julie Beckman and Keith Kaseman , was completed on schedule for its dedication on September 11 , 2008 .
The images were made public in response to a December 2004 Freedom of Information Act request by Judicial Watch .
Some still images from the video had previously been released and publicly circulated , but this was the first official release of the full video of the crash .
The Doubletree Hotel , located nearby in Crystal City , Virginia , also had a security camera video .
On December 4 , 2006 , the FBI released the video in response to a FOIA lawsuit filed by Scott Bingham .
The memorial specifically honors the five individuals for whom no identifiable remains were found .
This included Dana Falkenberg , age three , who was aboard American Airlines Flight 77 with her parents and older sister .
A portion of the remains of 25 other victims are also buried at the site .
The memorial is a pentagonal granite marker high .
On five sides of the memorial along the top are inscribed the words " Victims of Terrorist Attack on the Pentagon September 11 , 2001 " .
Aluminum plaques , painted black , are inscribed with the names of the 184 victims of the terrorist attack .
The site is located in Section 64 , on a slight rise , which gives it a view of the Pentagon .
At the National September 11 Memorial , the names of the Pentagon victims are inscribed on the South Pool , on Panels S-1 and S-72 – S-76 .
Ambushes have been used consistently throughout history , from ancient to modern warfare .
History In ancient times , an ambush often might involve thousands of soldiers on a large scale , such as over a mountain pass .
Ambushes appear many times in military history .
One outstanding example from ancient times is the Battle of the Trebia river .
When the Roman infantry became entangled in combat with his army , the hidden ambush force attacked the legionnaires in the rear .
The result was slaughter and defeat for the Romans .
Nevertheless the battle also displays the effects of good tactical discipline on the part of the ambushed force .
Although most of the legions were lost , about 10,000 Romans cut their way through to safety , maintaining unit cohesion .
This ability to maintain discipline and break out or maneuver away from a killing zone is a hallmark of good troops and training in any ambush situation .
See Ranger reference below .
Another famous ambush was that sprung by Germanic warchief Arminius against the Romans at Battle of the Teutoburg Forest .
This particular ambush was to have an impact on the course of Western history .
The Germanic forces demonstrated several principles needed for a successful ambush .
They took cover in difficult forested terrain , allowing the warriors time and space to mass without detection .
They had the element of surprise , and this was also aided by the defection of Arminius from Roman ranks prior to the battle .
They sprung the attack when the Romans were most vulnerable - when they had left their fortified camp , and were on the march in a pounding rainstorm .
The Germans also made use of blocking obstacles , erecting a trench and earthen wall to hinder Roman movement along the route of the killing zone .
The result was mass slaughter of the Romans , and the destruction of 3 legions .
The Germanic victory caused a limit on Roman expansion in the West .
The Roman Empire made no further concerted attempts to conquer Germania beyond the Rhine .
Planning Ambushes are complex , multi-phase operations , and are , therefore , usually planned in some detail .
First , a suitable killing zone is identified .
This is the place where the ambush will be laid .
A path along a wooded valley floor would be a typical example .
Ambush can be described geometrically as : Preparation To be successful , an ambush patrol must deploy into the area covertly , ideally under the cover of darkness .
The patrol will establish secure and covert positions overlooking the killing zone .
Usually , two or more “ cut-off ” groups will be sent out a short distance from the main ambushing group , into similarly covert positions .
Another group will cover the front and rear of the ambush position ( blocking force ) , and thus provide all round defence .
Waiting Having set up the ambush , the next phase is to wait .
This could be for a few hours , or a few days , depending on the tactical and supply situation .
Ambush patrols will almost always have to be self-sufficient , as re-supply would not be possible without compromising their position .
Execution The arrival of an enemy in the area should be signalled by one of the cut-off units .
This may be done by radio or by some other signal , but the enemy must not detect the signal .
If radio silence is necessary , the pre-electronic expedient of a cord linking the groups , tugged once or twice as a signal , may be employed .
The ambush commander will have given a clear instruction for initiating the ambush .
An ambush is ideally initiated by the most effective casualty-producing device available to the attacking elements .
This might be a burst from an automatic weapon , or the use of an antipersonnel explosive device ( such as a Claymore mine or other directional weapon ) .
Against vehicles , the lead and rear vehicles are the primary targets ; this traps the remaining vehicles in the kill zone for as long as possible .
Targets are prioritised to rapidly destroy the target 's unit cohesion .
It is vital to obtain fire superiority as rapidly as possible , to prevent enemy counter-ambush tactics from being executed .
After the firefight has been won , the now compromised ambush patrol must leave the area as soon as it is practical to do so .
In hit-and-run operations , especially against superior numbers and forces , the ambush force will begin disengaging even before the firefight has been won .
In the past , accepted protocol was to check bodies for intelligence , take prisoners , and ' treat ' any wounded enemy .
Once this was accomplished , the ambush patrol would then exfiltrate the area by a pre-determined route .
The published military doctrine is " immediate , positive , and offensive action " against the ambush .
But this is very likely to have been anticipated by the ones who set the ambush , and often plays into their hands .
The value of withdrawal is the preservation of the force to " live to fight another day " , when not taken by surprise .
Avoiding The best way to survive an ambush is not to encounter them .
In order for this to happen , patrol movement must n't be predictable in timing or route , and should avoid the most obvious routes .
Rather than moving at a constant speed and direction , the patrol should vary these , with occasional stops to observe both the route ahead , and changes behind .
Units on foot should have a point man some way ahead of the main body , and , if possible , a rearguard as well .
Those travelling in vehicles follow the same procedures , with lead and trailing vehicles well ahead of , and well behind , the main body of vehicles .
An abzyme ( from antibody and enzyme ) , also called catmab ( from catalytic monoclonal antibody ) , is a monoclonal antibody with catalytic activity .
Molecules which are modified to gain new catalytic activity are called synzymes .
Abzymes are potential tools in biotechnology , e.g. , to perform specific actions on DNA .
They are also useful in hydrolysis of esters .
Rate of hydrolysis was increased 100 times .
Enzymes function by lowering the activation energy of the transition state , thereby catalyzing the formation of an otherwise less-favorable molecular intermediate between reactants and products .
A new and unique type of enzyme is produced .
Once infected by HIV , patients produce antibodies to the more changeable parts of the viral coat .
The antibodies are ineffective because of the virus ' ability to change their coats rapidly .
The abzyme does more than bind to the site , it actually destroys the site , rendering HIV inert , and then can attach to other viruses .
A single abzyme can destroy thousands of HIV viruses .
Human clinical trials will be the next step in producing treatment and perhaps even preventative vaccines and microbicide References
A classic example is the evolution of a fourth cusp in the mammalian tooth .
This trait permits a vast increase in the range of foodstuffs which can be fed on .
Evolution of this character has thus increased the number of ecological niche s available to mammals .
The trait arose a number of times in different groups during the Cenozoic , and in each instance was immediately followed by an adaptive radiation .
Birds find other ways to provide for each other , i.e. the evolution of flight opened new avenues for evolution to explore , initiating an adaptive radiation .
Other examples include placental gestation ( for eutheria n mammals ) , or bipedal locomotion ( in hominins ) .
Opportunity Adaptive radiations often occur as a result of an organism arising in an environment with unoccupied niches , such as a newly formed lake or isolated island chain .
The colonizing population may diversify rapidly to take advantage of all possible niches .
Adaptive radiations commonly follow mass extinction s : following an extinction , many niches are left vacant .
It is the alternative form of a gene for a character producing different effects .
Sometimes , different alleles can result in different observable phenotypic trait s , such as different pigmentation .
However , many variations at the genetic level result in little or no observable variation .
Most multicellular organism s have two sets of chromosome s , that is , they are diploid .
These chromosomes are referred to as homologous chromosome s. Diploid organisms have one copy of each gene ( and therefore one allele ) on each chromosome .
Allelic variation at a locus is measurable as the number of alleles ( polymorphism ) present , or the proportion of heterozygotes in the population .
The degree and pattern of dominance varies among loci .
For a further discussion see Dominance ( genetics ) .
This type of interaction was first formally described by Gregor Mendel .
However , many traits defy this simple categorisation and the phenotypes are modeled by polygenic inheritance .
Allele and genotype frequencies The frequency of alleles in a diploid population can be used to predict the frequencies of the corresponding genotypes ( see Hardy-Weinberg principle ) .
Recessive genetic disorders include Albinism , Cystic Fibrosis , Galactosemia , Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) , and Tay-Sachs Disease .
Examples include red-green color blindness and Fragile X syndrome .
Other disorders , such as Huntington disease , occur when an individual inherits only one dominant allele .
Ampicillin is a beta-lactam antibiotic that is part of the aminopenicillin family and is roughly equivalent to its successor , amoxicillin in terms of spectrum and level of activity .
However , as with other penicillin drugs , it is relatively non-toxic and adverse effects of a serious nature are encountered only rarely .
Mechanism of action Belonging to the penicillin group of beta-lactam antibiotics , ampicillin is able to penetrate Gram-positive and some Gram-negative bacteria .
It differs from penicillin only by the presence of an amino group .
That amino group helps the drug penetrate the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria .
Ampicillin has received FDA approval for its mechanism of action .
In contrast , it has no effect on the plastid s of the higher developed vascular plant Lycopersicon esculentum L. ( tomato ) .
Of concern is the number of bacteria that have become resistant to Ampicillin necessitating combination therapy or use of other antibiotics .
All Pseudomonas and most strains of Klebsiella and Aerobacter are considered resistant .
Additionally , resistance to ampicillin is seen in enterobacter , citrobacter , serratia , indole-positive proteus species , and other hospital-acquired gram negative infections .
An ampicillin resistance gene ( abbreviated ampR ) is commonly used as a selectable marker in routine biotechnology .
The enzyme responsible for degrading ampicillin is called beta-lactamase , in reference to the beta-lactam structure of ampicillin and related drugs .
History Ampicillin has been used extensively to treat bacteria l infection s since 1961 .
Until the introduction of ampicillin by the British company Beecham , penicillin therapies had only been effective against Gram-positive organisms such as staphylococci and streptococci .
Ampicillin ( originally branded as ' Penbritin ' ) also demonstrated activity against Gram-negative organisms such as H. influenzae , coliform s and Proteus spp .
Ampicillin was the first of a number of so-called broad spectrum penicillins subsequently introduced by Beecham .
Annealing may refer to :
People do not develop resistance to antibiotics .
In the simplest cases , drug-resistant organisms may have acquired resistance to first-line antibiotics , thereby necessitating the use of second-line agents .
Some pathogens , such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa , additionally possess a high level of intrinsic resistance .
Many antibiotic resistance genes reside on transmissible plasmids , facilitating their transfer .
Exposure to an antibiotic naturally selects for the survival of the organisms with the genes for resistance .
In this way , a gene for antibiotic resistance may readily spread through an ecosystem of bacteria .
Antibiotic-resistance plasmids frequently contain genes conferring resistance to several different antibiotics .
This is not the case for Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the bacteria that causes Tuberculosis , since evidence is lacking for whether these bacteria have plasmids .
M. tuberculosis lack the opportunity to interact with other bacteria in order to share plasmids .
Genes for resistance to antibiotics , like the antibiotics themselves , are ancient .
However , the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections seen in clinical practice stems from antibiotic use both within human medicine and veterinary medicine .
Any use of antibiotics can increase selective pressure in a population of bacteria to allow the resistant bacteria to thrive and the susceptible bacteria to die off .
As resistance towards antibiotics becomes more common , a greater need for alternative treatments arises .
However , despite a push for new antibiotic therapies there has been a continued decline in the number of newly approved drugs .
Antibiotic resistance therefore poses a significant problem .
Nosocomial infection s overwhelmingly dominate cases where MDR pathogens are implicated , but multidrug-resistant infections are also becoming increasingly prevalent in the community .
In medicine , the major problem of the emergence of resistant bacteria is due to misuse and overuse of antibiotics .
In some countries , antibiotics are sold over the counter without a prescription , which also leads to the creation of resistant strains .
Other practices contributing towards resistance include the addition of antibiotics to livestock feed .
Household use of antibacterials in soaps and other products , although not clearly contributing to resistance , is also discouraged ( as not being effective at infection control ) .
Also unsound practices in the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry can contribute towards the likelihood of creating antibiotic-resistant strains .
In the case of MRSA , increased rates of MRSA infections are seen with glycopeptides , cephalosporin s and especially quinolones .
In the case of colonisation with Clostridium difficile the high risk antibiotics include cephalosporins and in particular quinolones and clindamycin .
Of antibiotics used in the United States in 1997 , half were used in humans and half in animals .
Natural occurrence There is evidence that naturally occurring antibiotic resistance is common .
The genes that confer this resistance are known as the environmental resistome .
These genes may be transferred from non-disease-causing bacteria to those that do cause disease , leading to clinically significant antibiotic resistance .
In 1952 an experiment conducted by Joshua and Esther Lederberg showed that penicillin - resistant bacteria existed before penicillin treatment .
While experimenting at the University of Wisconsin-Madison , Joshua Lederberg and his graduate student Norton Zinder also demonstrated preexistent bacterial resistance to streptomycin .
Six strains of Clostridium , found in the bowels of William Braine and John Hartnell ( members of Franklin Expedition ) showed resistance to cefoxitin and clindamycin .
This , however , was deemed circumstantial .
Search for a penicillinase ancestor has focused on the class of proteins that must be a priori capable of specific combination with penicillin .
Nonetheless there is an evidence that heavy metals and some pollutants may select for antibiotic-resistant bacteria , generating a constant source of them in small numbers .
In medicine The sheer volume of antibiotics prescribed is the major factor in increasing rates of bacterial resistance rather than compliance with antibiotics .
A single dose of antibiotics leads to a greater risk of resistant organisms to that antibiotic in the person for up to a year .
In some situations a short course is inferior to a long course .
One study found that with one antibiotic a short course was more effective , but with a different antibiotic , a longer course was more effective .
” Often , antibiotics can be safely stopped 72 hours after symptoms resolve .
Doctors must provide instructions to patients so they know when it is safe to stop taking a prescription since patients may feel better before the infection is eradicated .
Compliance with once-daily antibiotics is better than with twice-daily antibiotics .
Antibiotic-tolerant states may depend on physiological adaptations without direct connections to antibiotic target activity or to drug uptake , efflux , or inactivation .
The improper use of antibiotics and therapeutic treatments can often be attributed to the presence of structural violence in particular regions .
Socioeconomic factors such as race and poverty affect the accessibility of and adherence to drug therapy .
The efficacy of treatment programs for these drug-resistant strains depends on whether or not programmatic improvements take into account the effects of structural violence .
Role of other animals Drugs are used in animals that are used as human food , such as cattle , pigs , chickens , fish , etc. .
This mirrors the primary concerns in human medicine , where researchers and doctors were historically more concerned about effective but non-toxic doses of drugs rather than antibiotic resistance .
/ However , complete cooking of meat inactivates bacteria , whether or not they are antibiotic-resistant .
The World Health Organization concluded antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feeds should be prohibited , in the absence of risk assessments .
In 1998 , European Union health ministers voted to ban four antibiotics widely used to promote animal growth ( despite their scientific panel 's recommendations ) .
Regulation banning the use of antibiotics in European feed , with the exception of two antibiotics in poultry feeds , became effective in 2006 .
In Scandinavia , there is evidence that the ban has led to a lower prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in ( nonhazardous ) animal bacterial populations .
In the USA , federal agencies do not collect data on antibiotic use in animals , but animal-to-human spread of drug-resistant organisms has been demonstrated in research studies .
Antibiotics are still used in U.S. animal feed , along with other ingredients that represent safety concerns .
Hence , the amounts given are termed " sub-therapeutic " , i.e. , insufficient to combat disease — because no demonstrable disease is present .
Sub-therapeutic dosages kills some , but not all , of the bacterial organisms in the animal — leaving those that are naturally antibiotic-resistant .
Studies have shown , however , that the overall population levels of bacteria are essentially unchanged ; only the mix of bacteria is affected .
Thus the actual mechanism by which sub-therapeutic antibiotic feed additives serve as growth promotors is unclear .
The final decision to ban fluoroquinolones from use in poultry production was not made until five years later because of challenges from the food animal and pharmaceutical industries .
During 2007 , two federal bills ( S. 549 and H.R. 962 ) aimed at phasing out " nontherapeutic " antibiotics in US food animal production .
The Senate bill , introduced by Sen. Edward " Ted " Kennedy , died .
The House bill , introduced by Rep. Louise Slaughter , died after being referred to Committee .
The antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental pressure .
Those bacteria with a mutation that allows them to survive live to reproduce .
They then pass this trait to their offspring , which leads to the evolution of a fully resistant colony .
The four main mechanisms by which microorganisms exhibit resistance to antimicrobials are : There are three known mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance .
Some types of efflux pumps can act to decrease intracellular quinolone concentration .
In Gram-negative bacteria , plasmid-mediated resistance genes produce proteins that can bind to DNA gyrase , protecting it from the action of quinolones .
Finally , mutations at key sites in DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV can decrease their binding affinity to quinolones , decreasing the drug 's effectiveness .
Research has shown the bacterial protein LexA may play a key role in the acquisition of bacterial mutations giving resistance to quinolones and rifampicin .
For a long time it has been thought that for a microorganism to become resistant to an antibiotic , it must be in a large population .
However , recent findings show that there is no necessity of large populations of bacteria for the appearance of antibiotic resistance .
We know now , that small populations of E. coli in an antibiotic gradient can become resistant .
Researchers hypothesize that the mechanism of resistance development is based on four SNP mutations in the genome of E. coli produced by the gradient of antibiotic .
These mutations confer the bacteria emergence of antibiotic resistance .
A common misconception is that a person can become resistant to certain antibiotics .
It is a strain of microorganism that can become resistant , not a person 's body .
Resistant pathogens Staphylococcus aureus Staphylococcus aureus ( colloquially known as " Staph aureus " or a " Staph infection " ) is one of the major resistant pathogens .
Found on the mucous membranes and the human skin of around a third of the population , it is extremely adaptable to antibiotic pressure .
It was one of the earlier bacteria in which penicillin resistance was found — in 1947 , just four years after the drug started being mass-produced .
Methicillin was then the antibiotic of choice , but has since been replaced by oxacillin due to significant kidney toxicity .
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) was first detected in Britain in 1961 , and is now " quite common " in hospitals .
MRSA was responsible for 37 % of fatal cases of sepsis in the UK in 1999 , up from 4 % in 1991 .
Half of all S. aureus infections in the US are resistant to penicillin , methicillin , tetracycline and erythromycin .
This left vancomycin as the only effective agent available at the time .
The first identified case was in Japan in 1996 , and strains have since been found in hospitals in England , France and the US .
Linezolid-resistance in S. aureus was reported in 2003 .
MRSA is the most frequently identified antimicrobial drug-resistant pathogen in US hospitals .
The epidemiology of infections caused by MRSA is rapidly changing .
In the past 10 years , infections caused by this organism have emerged in the community .
CA-MRSA infections now appear endemic in many urban regions and cause most CA-S .
Streptococcus and Enterococcus Streptococcus pyogenes ( Group A Streptococcus : GAS ) infections can usually be treated with many different antibiotics .
Early treatment may reduce the risk of death from invasive group A streptococcal disease .
However , even the best medical care does not prevent death in every case .
For those with very severe illness , supportive care in an intensive care unit may be needed .
For persons with necrotizing fasciitis , surgery often is needed to remove damaged tissue .
Strains of S. pyogenes resistant to macrolide antibiotics have emerged ; however , all strains remain uniformly sensitive to penicillin .
Resistance of Streptococcus pneumoniae to penicillin and other beta-lactams is increasing worldwide .
The major mechanism of resistance involves the introduction of mutations in genes encoding penicillin-binding proteins .
Selective pressure is thought to play an important role , and use of beta-lactam antibiotics has been implicated as a risk factor for infection and colonization .
S. pneumoniae is responsible for pneumonia , bacteremia , otitis media , meningitis , sinusitis , peritonitis and arthritis .
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a highly prevalent opportunistic pathogen .
Pseudomonas aeruginosa has the ability to produce HAQs and it has been found that HAQs have prooxidant effects , and overexpressing modestly increased susceptibility to antibiotics .
Clostridium difficile Clostridium difficile is a nosocomial pathogen that causes diarrheal disease in hospitals world wide .
Geographically dispersed outbreaks of C. difficile strains resistant to fluoroquinolone antibiotics , such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin , were also reported in North America in 2005 .
Salmonella and E. coli Escherichia coli and Salmonella come directly from contaminated food .
When both bacteria are spread , serious health conditions arise .
Many people are hospitalized each year after becoming infected , with some dying as a result .
By 1993 , E. coli resistant to multiple fluoroquinolone variants was documented .
Most of these showed multidrug resistance ( MRAB ) , with a few isolates resistant to all drugs tested .
Mycobacterium tuberculosis Tuberculosis is increasing across the globe , especially in developing countries , over the past few years .
TB resistant to antibiotics is called MDR TB ( Multidrug Resistant TB ) .
The rise of the HIV/AIDS epidemic has contributed to this .
TB was considered one of the most prevalent diseases , and did not have a cure until the discovery of Streptomycin by Selman Waksman in 1943 .
However , the bacteria soon developed resistance .
Since then , drugs such as isoniazid and rifampin have been used .
M. tuberculosis develops resistance to drugs by spontaneous mutations in its genomes .
Resistance to one drug is common , and this is why treatment is usually done with more than one drug .
Extensively Drug Resistant TB ( XDR TB ) is TB that is also resistant to the second line of drugs .
Resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to isoniazid , rifampin , and other common treatments has become an increasingly relevant clinical challenge .
( For more on Drug Resistant TB , visit the Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis page . )
Alternatives Prevention Rational use of antibiotics may reduce the chances of development of opportunistic infection by antibiotic-resistant bacteria due to dysbacteriosis .
Nevertheless , new strains may evolve that escape immunity induced by vaccines ; for example an updated influenza vaccine is needed each year .
While theoretically promising , antistaphylococcal vaccines have shown limited efficacy , because of immunological variation between Staphylococcus species , and the limited duration of effectiveness of the antibodies produced .
Development and testing of more effective vaccines is under way .
The Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization ( CSIRO ) , realizing the need for the reduction of antibiotic use , has been working on two alternatives .
One alternative is to prevent diseases by adding cytokine s instead of antibiotics to animal feed .
These proteins are made in the animal body " naturally " after a disease and are not antibiotics , so they do not contribute to the antibiotic resistance problem .
Furthermore , studies on using cytokines have shown they also enhance the growth of animals like the antibiotics now used , but without the drawbacks of nontherapeutic antibiotic use .
Additionally , CSIRO is working on vaccines for diseases .
Phage therapy was widely used in the United States until the discovery of antibiotics , in the early 1940s .
Bacteriophages or " phages " are viruses that invade bacterial cells and , in the case of lytic phages , disrupt bacterial metabolism and cause the bacterium to lyse .
Phage therapy is the therapeutic use of lytic bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infections .
Bacteriophage therapy is an important alternative to antibiotics in the current era of multidrug resistant pathogens .
The success rate found in these studies was 80 – 95 % with few gastrointestinal or allergic side effects .
British studies also demonstrated significant efficacy of phages against Escherichia coli , Acinetobacter spp. , Pseudomonas spp .
US studies dealt with improving the bioavailability of phage .
Phage therapy may prove as an important alternative to antibiotics for treating multidrug resistant pathogens .
Discovery of the structure of the viral protein PlyC is allowing researchers to understand the way it kills a significant range of pathogenic bacteria .
Research New medications Until recently , research and development ( R&D ) efforts have provided new drugs in time to treat bacteria that became resistant to older antibiotics .
Infectious disease physicians are alarmed by the prospect that effective antibiotics may not be available to treat seriously ill patients in the near future .
The myxopyronin binds to and inhibits the crucial bacterial enzyme , RNA polymerase .
The myxopyronin changes the structure of the switch-2 segment of the enzyme , inhibiting its function of reading and transmitting DNA code .
This prevents RNA polymerase from delivering genetic information to the ribosomes , causing the bacteria to die .
In 2012 , a team of the University of Leipzig modified a peptide found in honeybees .
It is effective against 37 types of bacteria .
One major cause of antibiotic resistance is the increased pumping activity of microbial ABC transporters , which diminishes the effective drug concentration inside the microbial cell .
ABC transporter inhibitors that can be used in combination with current antimicrobials are being tested in clinical trials and are available for therapeutic regimens .
Applications Antibiotic resistance is an important tool for genetic engineering .
This ensures that the gene being manipulated passes along when the bacteria replicates .
The most commonly used antibiotics in genetic engineering are generally " older " antibiotics that have largely fallen out of use in clinical practice .
These include : Industrially the use of antibiotic resistance is disfavored since maintaining bacterial cultures would require feeding them large quantities of antibiotics .
Instead , the use of auxotrophic bacterial strains ( and function-replacement plasmids ) is preferred .
In immunology , an antigen is a substance that evokes the production of one or more antibodies .
Each antibody binds to a specific antigen by way of an interaction similar to the fit between a lock and a key .
The substance may be from the external environment or formed within the body .
The immune system will try to destroy or neutralize any antigen that is recognized as a foreign and potentially harmful invader .
Self " antigens are usually tolerated by the immune system , whereas " non-self " antigens can be identified as invaders and can be attacked by the immune system .
An immunogen is a specific type of antigen .
An immunogen is a substance that is able to provoke an adaptive immune response if injected on its own .
An immunogen is able to induce an immune response , whereas an antigen is able to combine with the products of an immune response once they are made .
Hapten is a small molecule , that can not induce an immune response by itself .
It needs to be attached to a large carrier molecule such as protein .
The overlapping concepts of immunogenicity and antigenicity are , therefore , subtly different .
Although all molecules that have the property of immunogenicity also have the property of antigenicity , the reverse is not true . "
At the molecular level , an antigen can sometimes be characterized by its ability to be " bound " at the antigen-binding site of an antibody .
Note also that antibodies tend to discriminate between the specific molecular structures presented on the surface of the antigen ( as illustrated in the Figure ) .
Non-microbial exogenous ( non-self ) antigens can include pollen , egg white , and proteins from transplanted tissues and organs or on the surface of transfused blood cells .
Vaccine s are examples of immunogenic antigens intentionally administered to induce acquired immunity in the recipient .
Cells present their immunogenic-antigens to the immune system via a histocompatibility molecule .
Depending on the antigen presented and the type of the histocompatibility molecule , several types of immune cell s can become activated .
He originally believed those substances to be precursors of antibodies , just like zymogen is a precursor of an enzyme .
The Oxford English Dictionary indicates that the logical construction should be " anti ( body ) - gen " .
Origin of antigens Antigens can be classified in order of their class .
Exogenous antigens Exogenous antigens are antigens that have entered the body from the outside , for example by inhalation , ingestion , or injection .
The immune system 's response to exogenous antigens is often subclinical .
By endocytosis or phagocytosis , exogenous antigens are taken into the antigen-presenting cell s ( APCs ) and processed into fragments .
APCs then present the fragments to T helper cells ( CD4 + ) by the use of class II histocompatibility molecules on their surface .
Some T cells are specific for the peptide : MHC complex .
Some antigens start out as exogenontigens , and later become endogenous ( for example , intracellular viruses ) .
Intracellular antigens can again be released back into circulation upon the destruction of the infected cell .
The fragments are then presented on the cell surface in the complex with MHC class I molecules .
If activated cytotoxic CD8 + T cells recognize them , the T cells begin to secrete various toxin s that cause the lysis or apoptosis of the infected cell .
Endogenous antigens include xenogenic ( heterologous ) , autologous and idiotypic or allogenic ( homologous ) antigens .
In this case , they are called tumor-specific antigen s ( TSAs ) and , in general , result from a tumor-specific mutation .
More common are antigens that are presented by tumor cells and normal cells , and they are called tumor-associated antigen s ( TAAs ) .
Cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognize these antigens may be able to destroy the tumor cells before they proliferate or metastasize .
Nativity A native antigen is an antigen that is not yet processed by an APC to smaller parts .
T cells can not bind native antigens , but require that they be processed by APCs , whereas B cells can be activated by native ones .
Antigen specificity is due primarily to the side-chain conformations of the antigen .
An autosome is a chromosome that is not an allosome ( i.e. , not a sex chromosome ) .
For example , human s have a diploid genome that usually contains 22 pairs of autosomes and one allosome pair ( 46 chromosomes total ) .
The allosome pair consists of two X chromosome s in females or one X and one Y chromosome in males .
Unusual combinations of XYY , XXY , XXX , XXXX , XXXXX or XXYY , among other allosome combinations , are known to occur .
( These usually cause developmental abnormalities . )
The autosome pairs are labeled with numbers ( 1-22 in humans ) roughly in order of their sizes in base pairs , while allosomes are labeled with their letters .
Antwerp is the name of a city , a district and a province in Flanders , Belgium : Antwerp is also the name of a number of places Other
It operates as a network comprising both a multinational , stateless army and a radical Sunni Muslim movement calling for global Jihad and a strict interpretation of sharia law .
Al-Qaeda has carried out several attacks on non-Muslims , and other targets it considers kafir .
Al-Qaeda has attacked civilian and military targets in various countries , including the September 11 attacks , 1998 U.S. embassy bombings and the 2002 Bali bombings .
The U.S. government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror .
Characteristic techniques employed by al-Qaeda include suicide attack s and simultaneous bombings of different targets .
Al-Qaeda ideologues envision a complete break from all foreign influences in Muslim countries , and the creation of a new world-wide Islamic caliphate .
Among the beliefs ascribed to Al-Qaeda members is the conviction that a Christian – Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam .
Al-Qaeda also opposes man-made law s , and wants to replace them with a strict form of sharia law .
Al-Qaeda is also responsible for instigating sectarian violence among Muslims .
Al-Qaeda is intolerant of non-Sunni branches of Islam and denounces them by means of excommunication s called " takfir " .
Al-Qaeda leaders regard liberal Muslims , Shia s , Sufi s and other sects as heretics and have attacked their mosques and gatherings .
Examples of sectarian attacks include the Yazidi community bombings , the Sadr City bombings , the Ashoura Massacre and the April 2007 Baghdad bombings .
Organization Al-Qaeda 's management philosophy has been described as " centralization of decision and decentralization of execution . "
Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda 's leadership .
There is no umbrella organisation .
We like to create a mythical entity called [ al-Qaeda ] in our minds , but that is not the reality we are dealing with . "
That particular name is very old .
It was born without any intention from us .
We are n't separated from this nation .
Others , however , see al-Qaeda as an integrated network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas and has a powerful strategic purpose .
Al-Qaeda has the following direct affiliates : Leadership Information mostly acquired from Jamal al-Fadl provided American authorities with a rough picture of how the group was organized .
He replaced Saif al-Adel , who had served as interim commander .
Bin Laden was advised by a Shura Council , which consists of senior al-Qaeda members , estimated by Western officials to consist of 20 – 30 people .
Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22 , 2011 .
On 5 June 2012 , Pakistan intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman 's replacement Abu Yahya al-Libi had been killed in Pakistan .
What exactly al-Qaeda is , or was , remains in dispute .
Author and journalist Adam Curtis argues that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention .
But there was no organization .
These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance .
He was not their commander .
I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was .
It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists .
It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden .
Field operatives The number of individuals in the organization who have undergone proper military training , and are capable of commanding insurgent forces , is largely unknown .
In 2006 , it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries .
As of 2009 , it was believed that no more than 200 – 300 members were still active commanders .
Insurgent forces According to Robert Cassidy , al-Qaeda controls two separate forces deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan .
The first , numbering in the tens of thousands , was " organized , trained , and equipped as insurgent combat forces " in the Soviet-Afghan war .
It was made up primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen .
Many went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad .
Another group , approximately 10,000 strong , live in Western states and have received rudimentary combat training .
It has been estimated that 62 % of al-Qaeda members have university education .
Financing Some financing for al-Qaeda in the 1990s came from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden .
By 2001 Afghanistan had become politically complex and mired .
With many financial sources for al-Qaeda Bin Laden 's financing role may have become comparatively minor .
Sources in 2001 could also have included Jamaa Al-Islamiyya and Islamic Jihad , both associated with Afghan-based Egyptians .
Other sources of income in 2001 included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait , Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries .
A WikiLeaks released memo from the United States Secretary of State sent in 2009 asserted that the primary source of funding of Sunni terrorist groups worldwide was Saudi Arabia .
Strategy On March 11 , 2005 , Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel 's document " Al Quaeda 's Strategy to the Year 2020 " .
Etymology In Arabic , al-Qaeda has four syllables ( , or ) .
al-Qaeda 's name can also be transliterated as al-Qaida , al-Qa ' ida , el-Qaida , or al-Qaeda .
The name comes from the Arabic noun qā ' idah , which means foundation or basis , and can also refer to a military base .
The initial al - is the Arabic definite article the , hence the base .
The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia 's terrorism .
We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda .
Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group , and contain the term " al-Qaeda " .
In April 2002 , the group assumed the name Qa'idat al-Jihad , which means " the base of Jihad " .
Some have argued that " without the writings " of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb , " al-Qaeda would not have existed . "
Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law , the Muslim world was no longer Muslim , having reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah .
We [ Khalifa and bin Laden ] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat , who we marry , how we talk .
We read Sayyid Qutb .
He was the one who most affected our generation .
Qutb had an even greater influence on bin Laden 's mentor and another leading member of al-Qaeda , Ayman al-Zawahiri .
Young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb 's character and the torment he had endured in prison . "
Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet 's Banner .
One of the most powerful of Qutb 's ideas was that many who said they were Muslims were not .
These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries , since they failed to enforce sharia law .
A CIA program called Operation Cyclone channeled funds through Pakistan 's Inter-Services Intelligence agency to the Afghan Mujahideen who were fighting the Soviet occupation .
Together , these sources donated some $ 600 million a year to jihad .
Al-Qaeda evolved from MAK .
Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987 .
U.S. government financial support for the Afghan Islamic militants was substantial .
Aid to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar , an Afghan mujahideen leader .
and founder and leader of the Hezb-e Islami radical Islamic militant faction , alone amounted " by the most conservative estimates " to $ 600 million .
Later , in the early 1990s , after the U.S. had withdrawn support , Hekmatyar " worked closely " with bin Laden .
In addition to receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in American aid , Hekmatyar was the recipient of the lion 's share of Saudi aid .
There is evidence that the CIA supported Hekmatyar 's drug trade activities by giving him immunity for his opium trafficking , which financed the operation of his militant faction .
MAK and foreign mujahideen volunteers , or " Afghan Arabs , " did not play a major role in the war .
Bin Laden played a central role in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers .
The Soviet Union finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 .
To the surprise of many , Mohammad Najibullah 's communist Afghan government hung on for three more years , before being overrun by elements of the mujahideen .
A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed , to further those aspirations .
One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda , formed by bin Laden with an initial meeting held on August 11 , 1988 .
According to Wright , the group 's real name was n't used in public pronouncements because " its existence was still a closely held secret . "
Bin Laden wished to establish non-military operations in other parts of the world ; Azzam , in contrast , wanted to remain focused on military campaigns .
After Azzam was assassinated in 1989 , the MAK split , with a significant number joining bin Laden 's organization .
In November 1989 , Ali Mohamed , a former special forces Sergeant stationed at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , left military service and moved to California .
He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became " deeply involved with bin Laden 's plans . "
Nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing .
In 1991 , Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden 's relocation to Sudan .
Gulf War and the start of U.S. enmity Following the Soviet Union 's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989 , bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia .
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk .
The world 's most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait , and Saddam 's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent .
In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence , Saudi Arabia 's own forces were well armed but far outnumbered .
Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to King Fahd to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army .
The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden 's offer , opting instead to allow U.S. and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory .
After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops , he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan .
Sudan From around 1992 to 1996 , al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician Hassan al Turabi .
The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan , led by Colonel Omar al-Bashir , who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values .
During this time , bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government , bought or set up various business enterprises , and established camps where insurgents trained .
Zawahiri and the EIJ , who served as the core of al-Qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the Egyptian government , had bad luck in Sudan .
In 1993 , a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful EIJ attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister , Atef Sedki .
Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings , and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad 's members and executed 6 .
His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend , $ 7 million ( $ today ) a year , and his Saudi assets were frozen .
His family publicly disowned him .
There is controversy over whether and to what extent he continued to garner support from members of his family and/or the Saudi government .
According to Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz , the Sudanese government offered the Clinton Administration numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden .
The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so .
Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin .
Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since , at the time , there was no indictment out-standing .
Refuge in Afghanistan After the Soviet withdrawal , Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between former allies and various mujahideen groups .
Throughout the 1990s , a new force began to emerge .
According to Ahmed Rashid , five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of Darul Uloom Haqqania , a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak .
The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan , but largely attended by Afghan refugees .
This institution reflected Salafi beliefs in its teachings , and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs .
Another four of the Taliban 's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar .
Many of the mujahideen who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi 's Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion .
This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters .
In 1994 , it captured the regional center of Kandahar , and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter , conquered the capital city Kabul in September 1996 .
While in Afghanistan , the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of Brigade 055 , an elite part of the Taliban 's army from 1997 – 2001 .
The Brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters , many veterans from the Soviet Invasion , and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen .
By the end of 2008 , some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda , while others cast doubt on this .
According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials , there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009 .
Call for global jihad Around 1994 , the Salafi groups waging jihad in Bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline .
As they grew less and less aggressive , groups such as EIJ began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe .
Al-Qaeda decided to step in and assumed control of around 80 % of the terrorist cells in Bosnia in late 1995 .
The concept of a " global Salafi jihad " had been around since at least the early 1980s .
Several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non-Muslims out of every Muslim land , at the same time , and with maximum carnage .
This was , however , a fundamentally defensive strategy .
Al-Qaeda sought to open the " offensive phase " of the global Salafi jihad .
Fatwas In 1996 , al-Qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands .
Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a fatwa .
However , they rejected the authority of the contemporary ulema ( which they saw as the paid servants of jahiliyya rulers ) , and took it upon themselves .
Former Russian FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko , who was later killed , said that the FSB trained al-Zawahiri in a camp in Dagestan eight months before the 1998 fatwa .
Iraq Al-Qaeda is Sunni , and often attacked the Iraqi Shia majority in an attempt to incite sectarian violence and greater chaos in the country .
Al-Zarqawi purportedly declared an all-out war on Shiites while claiming responsibility for Shiite mosque bombings .
Somalia and Yemen In Somalia , al-Qaeda agents had been collaborating closely with its Somali wing , which was created from the al-Shabaab group .
In February 2012 , al-Shabaab officially joined al-Qaeda , declaring loyalty in a joint video .
The Somalian al-Qaeda actively recruit children for suicide-bomber training , and export young people to participate in military actions against Americans at the AfPak border .
While al-Qaeda leaders are hiding in the tribal areas along the AfPak border , the middle-tier of the movement display heightened activity in Somalia and Yemen .
“ We know that South Asia is no longer their primary base , ” a U.S. defense agency source said .
“ They are looking for a hide-out in other parts of the world , and continue to expand their organization .
“ In January 2009 , al-Qaeda ’s division in Saudi Arabia merged with its Yemeni wing to form al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula .
Centered in Yemen , the group takes advantage of the country 's poor economy , demography and domestic security .
In August 2009 , they made the first assassination attempt against a member of the Saudi royal dynasty in decades .
Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the 2009 bombing attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab .
The group released photos of Abdulmutallab smiling in a white shirt and white Islamic skullcap , with the al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula banner in the background .
On September 11 , 2001 , al-Qaeda attacked the United States , hijacking four airliners and deliberately crashing them .
The attackers killed 2,977 people .
U.S. officials called Anwar al-Awlaki an " example of al-Qaeda reach into " the U.S. in 2008 after probes into his ties to the September 11 attacks hijackers .
A former FBI agent identifies Awlaki as a known " senior recruiter for al-Qaeda " , and a spiritual motivator .
Awlaki 's sermons in the U.S. were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers , as well as accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan .
U.S. intelligence intercepted emails from Hasan to Awlaki between December 2008 and early 2009 .
On his website , Awlaki has praised Hasan 's actions in the Fort Hood shooting .
In March 2010 , al Awlaki said in a videotape delivered to CNN that jihad against America was binding upon himself and every other able Muslim .
U.S. President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010 , making al-Awlaki the first U.S. citizen ever placed on the CIA target list .
That required the consent of the U.S. National Security Council , and officials said it was appropriate for an individual who posed an imminent danger to national security .
Representative Jane Harman called him " terrorist number one " , and Investor 's Business Daily called him " the world 's most dangerous man " .
In August 2010 , al-Awlaki 's father initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. government with the American Civil Liberties Union , challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki .
In October 2010 , U.S. and U.K. officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot .
In September 2011 , he was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen .
It was reported on March 16 , 2012 that Osama bin Laden plotted to kill United States President Barack Obama .
Bin Laden and those with him were killed during a firefight in which U.S. forces experienced no injuries or casualties .
According to one US official the attack was carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Pakistani authorities .
In Pakistan some people were reported to be shocked at the unauthorized incursion by US armed forces .
The site is a few miles from the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul .
In his broadcast announcement President Obama said that U.S. forces " took care to avoid civilian casualties . "
DNA from bin Laden 's body , compared with DNA samples on record from his dead sister , confirmed bin Laden 's identity .
One U.S. official stated that " finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world 's most wanted terrorist would have been difficult . "
Crowds gathered outside the White House and in New York City 's Time Square to celebrate Bin Laden 's death .
Attacks Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks , four of them in its jihad against America .
Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks , and very rarely makes wire transfers .
1992 On December 29 , 1992 , al-Qaeda 's first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in Aden , Yemen .
The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel .
The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort , Operation Restore Hope .
Internally , al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away , but in the U.S. the attack was barely noticed .
No Americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether , and they went on to Somalia as scheduled .
However little noticed , the attack was pivotal as it was the beginning of al-Qaeda 's change in direction , from fighting armies to killing civilians .
Two people were killed in the bombing , an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker .
Seven others , mostly Yemenis , were severely injured .
Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by Ibn Taymiyyah , a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis , which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions .
1993 World Trade Center bombing In 1993 , Ramzi Yousef used a truck bomb to attack the World Trade Center in New York City .
The attack was intended to break the foundation of Tower One knocking it into Tower Two , bringing the entire complex down .
Yousef hoped this would kill 250,000 people .
After the attack , Yousef fled to Pakistan and later moved to Manila .
He was later captured in Pakistan .
Late 1990s In 1996 , bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate Clinton while the president was in Manila for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation .
However , intelligence agents intercepted a message just minutes before the motorcade was to leave , and alerted the U.S. Secret Service .
Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge .
The 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa , resulting in upward of 300 deaths , mostly locals .
A barrage of cruise missile s launched by the U.S. military in response devastated an al-Qaeda base in Khost , Afghanistan , but the network 's capacity was unharmed .
Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack , al-Qaeda 's command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself .
September 11 attacks The September 11 , 2001 attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in American history , killing approximately 3,000 people .
Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11 , 2001 praised the attacks , and explained their motivation while denying any involvement .
Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims , such as the general perception that the U.S. was actively oppressing Muslims .
He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at women and children , but ' America 's icons of military and economic power ' .
Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the U.S. .
The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda , as it was feared that such an attack " might get out of hand " .
Before the U.S. attacked , it offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates .
The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA 's elite Special Activities Division ( SAD ) .
The Taliban offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the U.S. would provide evidence of bin Laden 's complicity in the attacks .
U.S. President George W. Bush responded by saying : " We know he 's guilty .
Turn him over " , and British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the Taliban regime : " Surrender bin Laden , or surrender power " .
Soon thereafter the U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan , and together with the Afghan Northern Alliance removed the Taliban government in the war in Afghanistan .
After being driven from their key positions in the Tora Bora area of Afghanistan , many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged Gardez region of the nation .
By early 2002 , al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity , and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success .
Nevertheless , a significant Taliban insurgency remains in Afghanistan , and al-Qaeda 's top two leaders , bin Laden and al-Zawahiri , evaded capture .
In September 2004 , the US government 9/11 Commission investigating the September 11 attacks officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives .
Mohammed Atef and several others were killed .
