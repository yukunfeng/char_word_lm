The Amazon is responsible for about 20 % of the Earth 's fresh water entering the ocean .
The river pushes a vast plume of fresh water into the ocean .
The plume is about long and between wide .
For centuries ships have reported fresh water near the Amazon 's mouth yet well out of sight of land in what otherwise seemed to be the open ocean .
The great deltas of the world are all in relatively protected bodies of water , while the Amazon empties directly into the turbulent Atlantic .
There is a natural water union between the Amazon and the Orinoco basins , the so-called Casiquiare canal .
The Casiquiare is a river distributary of the upper Orinoco , which flows southward into the Rio Negro , which in turn flows into the Amazon .
The Casiquiare is the largest river on earth that links two major river systems , a so-called bifurcation .
After the confluence of Apurímac and Ucayali , the river leaves Andean terrain and is surrounded by floodplain .
From this point to the Marañón , some , the forested banks are just out of water and are inundated long before the river attains its maximum flood stage .
The low river banks are interrupted by only a few hills , and the river enters the enormous Amazon Rainforest .
Flooding Not all of the Amazon 's tributaries flood at the same time of the year .
Many branches begin flooding in November and may continue to rise until June .
The rise of the Rio Negro starts in February or March and begins to recede in June .
The Madeira River rises and falls two months earlier than most of the rest of the Amazon .
The average depth of the Amazon between Manacapuru and Óbidos has been calculated as between .
At Manacapuru the Amazon 's water level is only about above mean sea level .
More than half of the water in the Amazon downstream of Manacapuru is below sea level .
In its lowermost section the Amazon 's depth averages , in some places as much as .
The main river is navigable for large ocean steamers to Manaus , upriver from the mouth .
Smaller ocean vessels of 3,000 tons or 9,000 tons and draft can reach as far as Iquitos , Peru , from the sea .
Smaller riverboats can reach higher as far as Achual Point .
Beyond that , small boats frequently ascend to the Pongo de Manseriche , just above Achual Point .
At Óbidos , a bluff above the river is backed by low hills .
The lower Amazon seems to have once been a gulf of the Atlantic Ocean , the waters of which washed the cliffs near Óbidos .
Only about ten percent of the Amazon 's water enters downstream of Óbidos , very little of which is from the northern slope of the valley .
The Tocantins River enters the Amazon very close to its mouth .
These hills are cut down to a kind of terrace which lies between them and the river .
If the Pará river and the Marajó island ocean frontage are included , the Amazon estuary is some wide .
It is the richest tropical forest in the world in terms of biodiversity .
There are over 2,100 species of fish currently recognized in the Amazon Basin , with more being discovered every year .
Mammals Along with the Orinoco , the Amazon is one of the main habitats of the boto , also known as the Amazon river dolphin ( Inia geoffrensis ) .
It is the largest species of river dolphin , and it can grow to lengths of up to .
The color of its skin changes with age .
It varies from gray when it is young , to pink and white as it matures .
The dolphins use echolocation to navigate and hunt in the river 's tricky depths .
The boto is the subject of a legend in Brazil about a dolphin that turns into a man and seduces maidens by the riverside .
The Amazonian manatee ( Trichechus inunguis ) also known as " seacow " is found in the northern Amazon River Basin and its tributaries .
It is a mammal and an herbivore .
Its population is limited to fresh water habitats and unlike other manatees , it does not venture into salt water .
It is classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
The Amazon and its tributaries are the main habitat of the giant otter ( Pteronura brasiliensis ) .
It is a member of the weasel family and is the largest of its kind .
Because of habitat destruction and hunting its population has dramatically decreased .
Reptiles The anaconda is found in shallow waters in the Amazon Basin .
One of the world 's largest species of snake , the anaconda spends most of its time in the water , with just its nostrils above the surface .
In addition to the thousands of species of fish , the river supports crabs , algae , and turtles .
The caiman , which is related to alligators and other crocodilians , also inhabits the Amazon .
The arapaima , known in Brazil as the pirarucu ( Arapaima gigas ) , is a South American tropical freshwater fish .
It is one of the largest freshwater fish in the world , reportedly with a maximum length of and weight up to .
Also present in large numbers is the notorious piranha , an omnivorous fish which congregates in large schools and may attack livestock and even humans .
There are approximately 30 to 60 species of piranha .
However , only a few of its species are known to attack humans , most notably Pygocentrus nattereri , the red-bellied piranha .
The candirú are a number of general parasitic , fresh water catfish in the family Trichomycteridae ; all are native to the Amazon River .
The electric eel ( Electrophorus electricus ) and more than 100 species of weakly electric fishes Gymnotiformes also inhabit the Amazon Basin .
In 1500 , Vicente Yáñez Pinzón was the first European to sail into the river .
For instance the pre-Columbian culture on the island of Marajó may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000 people .
He was ordered to follow the Coca River and return when the river reached its confluence .
This area around the Amazon was dominated by the Icamiaba natives , who were mistaken for fierce female warriors by the members of the expedition .
Orellana claimed that he had found great cinnamon trees there , in other words a source of one of the most important spices reaching Europe from the East .
In fact , true cinnamon ( Cinnamomum verum ) is not native to South America .
Other related cinnamon-containing plants ( of the family Lauraceae ) do occur , and Orellana may have observed some of these .
In 1560 , another Spanish conquistador , Lope de Aguirre , made the second descent of the Amazon .
Teixeira 's expedition was massive — some 2,000 people in 37 large canoes .
Father Fritz , apostle of the Omaguas , established some forty mission villages .
Charles Marie de La Condamine accomplished the first scientific exploration of the Amazon River .
Many indigenous tribes engaged in constant warfare .
The Brazilian Amazon 's principal commercial city , Pará ( now Belém ) , had from 10,000 to 12,000 inhabitants , including slaves .
The town of Manáos , now Manaus , at the mouth of the Rio Negro , had a population between 1,000 to 1,500 .
All the remaining villages , as far up as Tabatinga , on the Brazilian frontier of Peru , were relatively small .
This was the first step in opening up the vast interior .
In that same period , the Amazonas Company was increasing its fleet .
Meanwhile , private individuals were building and running small steam craft of their own on the main river as well as on many of its tributaries .
The Brazilian decree took effect on 7 September 1867 .
Foreign companies settled in Iquitos , from whence they controlled the extraction of rubber .
In 1851 Iquitos had a population of 200 , and by 1900 its population reached 20,000 .
During the rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants such as typhus or malaria killed 40,000 native Amazonians .
The first direct foreign trade with Manaus was commenced around 1874 .
20th - and 21st-century concerns Four centuries through the forests , and in 1970 , the work on the Trans-Amazonian highway ( Transamazônica ) network began .
The network 's three pioneering highways were completed within ten years but never fulfilled their promise .
Large portions of the Trans-Amazonian and its accessory roads , such as BR-319 ( Manaus - Porto Velho ) , are derelict and impassable in the rainy season .
Small towns and villages are scattered across the forest , and because its vegetation is so dense , some remote areas are still unexplored .
With a current population of 1.8 million people , Manaus is the Amazon 's largest city .
Manaus alone represents approximately 50 % of the population of the Brazilian state of Amazonas , which is the largest state .
The racial makeup of the city is 64 % Pardo ( Mulatto and mestizo ) and 32 % White .
However , the Amazon has been measured by different geographers as being anywhere between long .
It is often said to be " at least " long .
The Nile is reported to be anywhere from .
Often it is said to be " about " long .
There are many factors that can affect these measurements .
A study by Brazilian scientists concluded that the Amazon is actually longer than the Nile .
They calculated the Amazon 's length as .
Using the same techniques they calculated the length of the Nile as , which is longer than previous estimates but still shorter than the Amazon .
However , other geographers have had access to the same data since 2001 , and a consensus has yet to emerge to support the claims of these Brazilian scientists .
The length of both the Amazon and the Nile remains open to interpretation and continued debate .
It flows from the Andean foothills to the Atlantic coast in a nearly west-to-east direction like the Amazon River .
The discovery was made public in August 2011 meeting of the Brazilian Geophysical Society in Rio de Janeiro .
Except for the flow direction , the Amazon and the Hamza have very different characteristics .
The most obvious ones are their width and flow speed .
While the Amazon is 1 km to 100 km wide , the Hamza is 200 km to 400 km in width .
But the flow speed is five meters per second in the Amazon and less than a millimeter per second speed in the Hamza .
Several geological factors have played a vital role in the formation and existence of these subterranean water bodies .
The underground ocean , discovered in 2007 , has been formed when the plate carrying the Pacific Ocean bottom gets dragged and ends up under the continental plate .
Water at such depths would normally escape upwards but the unusual conditions that exist along the eastern Pacific Rim allow the moisture to remain intact .
In the case of the Hamza , the porous and permeable sedimentary rocks behave as conduits for the water to sink to greater depths .
East-west trending faults and the karst topography present along the northern border of the Amazon basin may have some role in supplying water to the river .
If the impermeable rocks stop the vertical flow , the west to east gradient of the topography directs it to flow towards the Atlantic Ocean .
Water in these places drills its way downward by dissolving the carbonate rock to form an extensive underground river system .
Major tributaries The Amazon has over 1,100 tributaries , 17 of which are over long .
Some of the more notable ones are : List by length See also References External links

Geoffrey of Monmouth and Simeon of Durham are Allured 's chief sources .
Autpert Ambrose ( Ambroise ) ( ) ( ca. 730 – 784 ) was a Frankish Benedictine monk .
He became abbot of San Vicenzo on the Volturno in South Italy in the time of Desiderius , king of the Lombards .
Autpert 's election as abbot caused internal dissent at St. Vicenzo , and both Pope Stephen III and Charlemagne intervened .
The disagreement was based both on objections to Autpert 's personality and to his Frankish origin .
He wrote a considerable number of works on the Bible and religious subjects generally .
In 2009 , Pope Benedict XVI gave a homily about him in Saint Peter 's square .
In this homily , Autpert 's death date is given as 784 ( older scholarship had given a date between 778 and 779 ) .
He ruled over the Rashidun Caliphate from 632 – 634 CE when he became the first Muslim Caliph following Muhammad 's death .
He was called Al-Siddiq ( The Truthful ) and was known by that title among later generations of Muslims .
He eventually came to be recognized as the chief of his clan .
On his return from a business trip to Yemen , he was informed that in his absence Muhammad had openly declared his prophethood .
Not long after , Abu Bakr accepted Islam and was the first person outside the family of Muhammad to openly become a Muslim .
Abu Bakr served as a trusted advisor and close friend to Muhammad .
He also participated in the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and was made one of the witnesses over the pact .
Abu Bakr 's Caliphate lasted for a little over two years ( or 27 months ) , ending with his death after an illness .
He set in motion a historical trajectory that in few decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history .
In Arabic , the name ' Abd Allah ' means " servant of Allah " .
One of his early titles , preceding his conversion to Islam , was atiqe , " the saved one " .
Muhammad later reaffirmed this title when he said that Abu Bakr is the ' atiqe ' ( the one saved from hell fire by God ) .
There is a dispute over his name being Abdullah .
Ibn Hajar in Al-Isaabah , vol .
4 , p. 146 and many other narrations , narrates from Qasim Ibn Muhammad Ibn Abi Bakr , " I asked Ayesha the name of Abu Bakr .
I said people are saying Ateeq .
She said Abu Quhafa had three children , one was Ateeq , second Mu ’ taq and third , Otaiq .
All three names are similar and derived from the same root . "
Imam Jafar al Sadiq famously narrated how the title Siddiq was given to Abu Bakr from Muhammad .
He was also a direct descendant of Abu Bakr from his maternal side , as well as being a paternal descendant of Ali from his father 's side .
Jafar al-Sadiq was also the successor of the Naqshbandi Sufi order originating from Abu Bakr himself . .
Much of the knowledge we have about Muhammand is narrated through Aisha .
Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the son of Abu Bakr and after the passing of Abu Bakr , Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was raised by Ali .
After Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was killed by the Umayyads , Aisha raised and taught her nephew al-Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr .
Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grandson of Abu Bakr and the grandfather of Ja ' far al-Sadiq .
Aishas also taught her nephew Urwah ibn Zubayr .
He then taught his son Hisham ibn Urwah , who was the main teacher of Malik ibn Anas whose views many Sunni follow .
Qasim 's mother was of ‘ Ali 's family and his daughter Farwah bint al-Qasim , who married Muhammad al-Baqir , was the mother of Jafar al-Sadiq .
Therefore al-Qasim was the grandson of the first caliph Abu Bakr and the grandfather of Ja ' far al-Sadiq .
Imam Muhammad al Baqir , the father of Imam Jafar Sadiq also called Abu Bakr with the title Siddiq .
Abu Bakr 's other grandson Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr was also very close to Husayn bin Ali .
Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr left and was later also killed and crucified by the Syrian Roman Army now under the control of the Umayyads .
Early life Abu Bakr was born in Mecca some time in 573 CE , to a rich family in the Banu Taym clan of the Quraysh tribe .
Abu Bakr 's father 's name was Uthman Abu Quhafa ( nicknamed Abu Quhafa ) and his mother was Salma Umm-ul-Khair ( nicknamed Umm-ul-Khair ) .
Abu Bakr was a thin man with white skin .
When Abu Bakr was 10 years old , he went to Syria along with his father with the merchants ' caravan .
Muhammad , who was 12 years old at the time , was also with the caravan .
In 591 at the age of 18 , Abu Bakr went into trade and adopted the profession of cloth merchant , which was the family 's business .
In the coming years Abu Bakr traveled extensively with caravans .
Business trips took him to Yemen , Syria , and elsewhere .
These travels brought him wealth and added to his experience .
His business flourished and he rose in the scale of social importance .
Though his father , Uthman Abu Quhafa , was still alive , he came to be recognized as chief of his tribe .
Like other children of the rich Meccan merchant families , Abu Bakr was literate and developed a fondness for poetry .
He used to attend the annual fair at Ukaz , and participate in poetical symposia .
He had a very good memory and had a good knowledge of the genealogy of the Arab tribes , their stories and their politics .
A story is preserved that once when he was a child , his father took him to the Kaaba , and asked him to pray before the idols .
His father went away to attend to some other business , and Abu Bakr was left alone with the idols .
Addressing an idol , Abu Bakr said " O my God , I am in need of beautiful clothes ; bestow them on me " .
The idol remained indifferent .
Then he addressed another idol saying " O God , give me some delicious food .
See that I am so hungry " .
The idol remained cold .
That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr .
He lifted a stone , and addressing an idol said " Here I am aiming a stone ; if you are a god protect yourself " .
Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the Kaaba .
Thereafter , he never went to the Kaaba to pray to the idols .
He said , ' No , more than fifty people embraced Islam before Abu Bakr ; but he was superior to us as a Muslim .
And Umar ibn Khattab had embraced Islam after forty-five men and twenty-one women .
Life after accepting Islam His wife Qutaylah bint Abd-al-Uzza did not accept Islam and he divorced her .
His other wife , Um Ruman , became a Muslim .
All his children except Abdu ' l-Rahman ibn Abu Bakr accepted Islam , and Abu Bakr separated from his son Abdu ' l-Rahman .
His conversion brought many people to Islam .
He persuaded his intimate friends to convert to Islam .
and presented Islam to others in such a way that many of his friends accepted Islam .
Those who converted to Islam at the insistence of Abu Bakr were : Abu Bakr 's acceptance proved to be a milestone in Muhammad 's mission .
Slavery was common in Mecca , and many slaves accepted Islam .
When an ordinary free man accepted Islam , despite opposition , he would enjoy the protection of his tribe .
For slaves however , there was no such protection and they commonly experienced persecution .
The men were The women were : Most of the slaves liberated by Abu Bakr were either women or old and frail men .
Shias maintain these verses were revealed about Ali .
And the Sahabis ( Companinons ) knew the virtues of Abu Bakr . "
What about Abu Bakr ? "
The Prophet Muhammad ( Peace and blessings be upon him ) " For the likes of Abu Bakr !
there are no scales !
The Iman of Abu Bakr would weigh more heavily than the entirety of Humanity . "
Persecution by the Quraysh , 613 For three years after the advent of Islam , Muslims kept secret their faith , and prayed in secret .
In 613 Muhammad decided to call people to Islam openly .
The first public address inviting people to offer allegiance to Muhammad was delivered by Abu Bakr .
In a fit of fury the young men of the Quraysh tribe rushed at Abu Bakr , and beat him mercilessly till he lost consciousness .
Following this incident Abu Bakr 's mother converted to Islam .
Abu Bakr was persecuted many times by the Quraysh .
Abu Bakr 's beliefs would have been defended by his own clan , but not by the entire Quraysh tribe .
Soon he felt hard pressed and asked permission of Muhammad to go to Abyssinia .
The permission was granted and Abu Bakr set off on his journey .
However , on the way he met Ibn al-Daghinna , the chief of Qara .
Under Ibn al-Daghinna 's protection , he soon came back to Mecca .
Last years in Mecca In 617 , the Quraysh enforced a boycott against the Banu Hashim .
Muhammad along with his supporters from Banu Hashim , were cut off in a pass away from Mecca .
All social relations with the Banu Hashim were cut off and their state was that of imprisonment .
Before it many Muslims migrated to Abyssinia ( now Ethiopia ) .
Abu Bakr , feeling distressed , set out for Yemen and then to Abyssinia from there .
He met a friend of his named Ad-Dughna ( chief of the Qarah tribe ) outside Mecca , who invited Abu Bakr to seek his protection against the Quraysh .
Once again the Quraysh were free to persecute Abu Bakr .
In 620 Muhammad 's wife and uncle died .
Abu Bakr 's daughter Aisha was engaged to Muhammad , however it was decided that the actual marriage ceremony would be held later .
In 620 Abu Bakr was the first person to testify to Muhammad 's Isra and Mi ' raj ( night Journey ) .
Migration to Medina In 622 , on the invitation of the Muslims of Medina , Muhammad ordered Muslims to migrate to Medina .
The migration began in batches .
Meanwhile Abu Bakr accompanied Muhammad in his migration for Medina .
Due to the danger of the Quraysh , they did not take the road to Medina .
They moved in the opposite direction , and took refuge in a cave in Jabal Thawr some five miles south of Mecca .
Asma bint Abi Bakr , the daughter of Abu Bakr , brought them meals every day .
Aamir , a servant of Abu Bakr , would bring a flock of goats to the mouth of the cave every night where they were milked .
The Quraysh sent search parties in all directions .
One party came close to the entrance to the cave , but was unable to sight them .
But the word of Allah is exalted to the heights : for Allah is Exalted in might , Wise .
He answered , " Slave of the fulan , someone of the Quraish . "
He mentioned the name of his master and I knew him , then I asked , " Does your sheep have milk ? "
He answered , " Yes ! "
Life in Medina In Medina , Muhammad decided to construct a mosque .
A piece of land was chosen and the price of the land was paid for by Abu Bakr .
Muslims constructed a mosque named Al-Masjid al-Nabawi at the site and Abu Bakr also took part in construction .
Abu Bakr was paired with Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari ( who was from Medina ) as a brother in faith .
Abu Bakr 's relationship with Khaarjah was most cordial , which was further strengthened when Abu Bakr married Habiba , a daughter of Khaarijah .
Khaarij ah bin Zaid Ansari used to live at Sunh , a suburb of Medina , and Abu Bakr also settled there .
After Abu Bakr 's family arrived in Medina he bought another house near Muhammad 's .
Abu Bakr also suffered from fever for several days and during this time he was attended to by Khaarijah and his family .
At Mecca , Abu Bakr was a trader in cloth and he started the same business in Medina .
He was a wholesaler , and had his store at Sunh , and from there cloth was supplied to the market at Medina .
Soon his business flourished at Medina .
In 625 he participated in the Battle of Uhud which ended in a rout by the majority of the Muslims .
Abu Bakr accepted the challenge but was stopped by Muhammad .
His son later converted to Islam and gained fame during the Muslim conquest of Syria as a fierce warrior .
In the second phase of the battle , Khalid ibn al-Walid ’s cavalry attacked the Muslims from behind , changing a Muslim victory to defeat .
However it is related that once Ali asked his associates as to who they thought was the bravest among men .
Everyone replied that Ali was the bravest of all men .
Thereupon Ali said : In Sunni accounts during one such attack , two discs from Abu Bakr 's shield penetrated into Muhammad 's cheeks .
In these stories subsequently Abu Bakr , along with other companions , led Muhammad to a place of safety .
Conflict with Jewish tribes Later in the year Abu Bakr was a part of campaign against the Jew ish tribe of Banu Nadir .
Battle of the Trench In 627 he participated in the Battle of the Trench and also in the Invasion of Banu Qurayza .
In this battle , Muhammad divided the ditch into a number of sectors and a contingent was posted to guard each sector .
One of such contingents was under the command of Abu Bakr .
The enemy made frequent assaults in the attempt to cross the ditch .
All such assaults were repulsed .
Abu Bakr showed great courage in guarding the belt of the trench in his sector .
To commemorate this event a mosque was later constructed at the site where Abu Bakr had heroically repulsed the charges of the enemy .
The mosque was later known as ' Masjid-i-Siddiq ' .
In 628 he participated in Treaty of Hudaybiyyah and was made one of the witnesses over the pact .
In 628 he was a part of the Muslim campaign to Khaybar .
Commanding an army under him were Abu Bakr and Umar and they attacked and defeated the enemy .
In 630 when Muslim armies rushed for the Conquest of Mecca , Abu Bakr was a part of the army .
Before the conquest of Mecca his father Uthman Abu Quhafa converted to Islam .
Battle of Hunayn and Ta'if In 630 he was part of Battle of Hunayn and Siege of Ta'if .
Taken unaware the advance guard of the Muslim army fled in panic .
There was considerable confusion , and the camels , horses and men ran into one another in the attempt to seek cover .
There were only nine companions around him including Abu Bakr .
All the rest had fled .
Under the instructions of Muhammad , Abbas shouted at the top of his voice " O Muslims come to the Prophet of Allah " .
The call was heard by the Muslim soldiers and they gathered beside Muhammad .
When the Muslim had gathered in sufficient number , Muhammad ordered a charge against the enemy .
In the hand to hand fight that followed the tribes were routed and they fled to Autas .
Muhammad posted a contingent to guard the Hunayn pass and led the main army to Autas .
In the confrontation at Autas the tribes could not withstand the Muslim onslaught .
Finding the resistance useless the tribes broke the camp and retired to Ta'if .
Abu Bakr was commissioned by Muhammad to lead the attack against Ta'if .
From Autas the Muslim forces set out for Ta'if .
The tribes shut themselves in the fort and refused to come out in the open .
The Muslim employed catapults to throw stones in the town , but this did not lead to any tangible results .
The Muslim tried the testudo device whereunder a group of soldiers shielded by a cover of cowhide advanced to set fire to the gate .
The enemy threw red hot scraps of iron on the testudo which made it ineffective .
The siege dragged on for two weeks , and still there was no sign of the fall of the fort .
Muhammad held a council of war .
Abu Bakr advised that the siege might be raised and that God would Himself make arrangements for the fall of the fort .
The advice was accepted , and in February 630 , the siege of Ta'if was raised and the Muslim army returned to Mecca .
A few days later Malik bin Auf the commander , came to Mecca and became a Muslim .
Thus the forecast of Abu Bakr came to be fulfilled , and the God Himself arranged for the surrender of Ta'if .
Expedition of Tabuk In 630 AD Muhammad decided to lead an expedition to Tabuk on the Syrian border .
In order to finance the expedition Muhammad invited contributions and donations from his followers .
Uthman provided ten thousand camels .
Umar made a liberal contribution .
Then Abu Bakr came loaded with his contribution and Muhammad put him the same question as to how much wealth he had for himself and his family .
Abu Bakr said " I have brought all that I had .
I have left Allah and His Prophet for myself and my family " .
This episode has formed the theme of one of the poems of Allama Iqbal .
The last verse of this poem reads : The call to arms was given at a very critical period .
The weather was burning hot .
Crops were ripe and ready for harvesting .
The journey was long and arduous .
Many persons preferred to stay back .
In spite of these obstacles and difficulties , an army of thirty thousand persons was raised .
The army assembled at Al Jorf outside Medina .
Muhammad remained at Medina for some time to attend to other affairs , and at Al Jorf Abu Bakr deputised for Muhammad and led the prayers .
The Muslim army reached Tabuk after a weary march .
At Tabuk the standard of the army was entrusted to Abu Bakr .
There were no Byzantine forces to meet the Muslims .
On coming to know of the advance of the Muslim army the Byzantines had withdrawn their army well within Syria .
The Muslim achieved their object without fighting a shot .
The Byzantines who had at one time threatened to invade Arabia were no longer in the mood to measure swords with the Muslims .
Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj In 631 AD , Muhammad sent from Medina a delegation of three hundred Muslims to perform the Hajj according to the new Islamic way .
Abu Bakr was appointed as the leader of the delegates .
Abu Bakr had thus the honour of being the First Amir-ul-Hajj in the history of Islam .
It is related that when this revelation came , some one suggested to Muhammad that he should send news of it to Abu Bakr .
Muhammad said that only a man of his house could proclaim the revelation .
Muhammad summoned Ali , and asked him to proclaim the revealed verses to the people on the day of sacrifice when they assembled at Mina .
Ali went forth on Muhammad 's slit-eared camel , and overtook Abu Bakr .
When Ali joined the party , Abu Bakr wanted to know whether he had come to give orders or to convey them .
At Mecca , Abu Bakr presided at the Hajj ceremony , and Ali read the proclamation on behalf of Muhammad .
The main points of the proclamation were : From the day this proclamation was made a new era dawned in Arabia .
Henceforward Islam alone was to be supreme in Arabia .
On this occasion Ali did not replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj .
Ali was merely assigned a special mission to read the proclamation as according to Muhammad only a man from his own house could communate the revelation .
We can thus say that on this occasion Abu Bakr represented the temporal side , while Ali represented the spiritual side .
Many were killed and taken as prisoner .
The Sunni Hadith collection , Sunan Abu Dawud mentions the event Death of Muhammad A short time after returning from the farewell pilgrimage , Muhammad became ill .
In his fatal illness , Muhammad came out with a piece of cloth tied around his head and sat on the pulpit .
So he has chosen that good which is with Allah . "
Abu Bakr wept profusely and said , " Our fathers and mothers be sacrificed for you . "
The companions were astonished by this ( they wondered why Abu Bakr wept ) , and the people said , " Look at this old man !
It turned out Muhammad himself was that servant , as Abu Bakr later told the companions .
Muhammad continued : No doubt , I am indebted to Abu Bakr more than to anybody else regarding both his companionship and his wealth .
And if I had to take a Khalil from my followers , I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr , but the fraternity of Islam is sufficient .
Let no Door of the Mosque remain open , except the door of Abu Bakr The good referred in the first part means the good in the hereafter .
Khalil means intimate friend .
The door referred to here is the door to the mosque of Muhammad .
When the fever developed he directed Abu Bakr to go to the war following Usama who was 18 .
When Muhammad died Muslims gathered in Al-Masjid al-Nabawi and there were suppressed sobs and sighs .
Abu Bakr came from his house at As-Sunh ( a village ) on a horse where he had been with his new wife .
He dismounted and entered the Prophet 's Mosque , but did not speak to anyone until he entered upon ' Aa'isha .
He went straight to Muhammad who was covered with Hibra cloth ( a kind of Yemenite cloth ) .
He then uncovered Muhammad 's face and bowed over him and kissed him and wept , saying , " Let my father and mother be sacrificed for you .
By Allah , Allah will never cause you to die twice .
As for the death which was written for you , has come upon you . " '
Musa returned after it was said that he had died .
By Allah , the Messenger of Allah will come back and he will cut off the hands and legs of those who claim his death . "
Abu Bakr arrived and said , " Sit down , O ' Umar ! "
But ' Umar refused to sit down .
So the people came to Abu Bakr and left Umar .
And whoever turns back upon his heels , he will by no means do harm to Allah in the least and Allah will reward the grateful . "
He chose the latter . "
And that slave was Allah 's Apostle himself .
Abu Bakr knew more than us .
The Prophet said , " O Abu Bakr !
The Prophet added : Abu - Bakr has favored me much with his property and company .
If I were to take a Khalil from mankind I would certainly have taken Abu Bakr but the Islamic brotherhood and friendship is sufficient .
Close all the gates in the mosque except that of Abu Bakr .
Ayshah reported that Muhammad said , " It does not behoove a people who have Abu Bakr among them to have anybody other than him as their imam . "
from Sahih Muslim Jubayr ibn Mut ' im reported that a woman came and spoke to Muhammad about a matter .
He asked her to come back later some time .
She said , " Tell me if I come later and do not find you ? "
Jubayr ibn Mut ' im said that it seemed that she meant he may not be alive when she came back .
He said , " If you do not find me then go to Abu Bakr . "
Abu Bakr said , " O Messenger of Allah !
I wish that I had been with you and seen the gate ! "
So , Muhammad said , " Know , O Abu Bakr , you will be the first of my Ummah to enter Paradise . "
Ibn Umar said that one day , Muhammad came out and entered the masjid , Abu Bakr and Umar with him , to his right and left .
Muhammad had held their hands and he said , " The three of us will be raised on the Day of Resurrection in this way . "
So , my wazeer from the dwellers of heaven are Jibrael and Mikael and my wazeer from the earthlings are Abu Bakr and Umar . "
Other Arabic tribes also wished to revert to local leadership and split from Medina 's control .
In some places , people claiming prophethood started to establish leaderships to oppose Medina , e.g. Al-Aswad Al-Ansi and Musaylimah .
All of which are events that led to splitting the Muslim community .
Accounts of this meeting vary greatly .
Sunnis believe that all the Muslims in Madina gave their allegiance to Abu Bakr , including Ali .
All Sunnis acknowledged Abu Bakr as the rightful successor to Muhammad .
Examples of these include Muhammad specifically designating Abu Bakr to lead the Muslims in prayer in his last days when he was too ill to lead the prayer .
Muhammad also appointed to Abu Bakr to lead the pilgrimage to Makka .
According to Sunnis all of these show the virtue of Abu Bakr and his being the rightful successor .
The Twelver Shia and the Ismaili Shia believe that only the decendents of Ali should rule .
Because of the relative insecurity of property ownership in Persia , many private landowners secured their lands by donating them to the clergy as so called vaqf .
Before that point Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who disapproved of his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph .
If I do well , help me ; and if I do wrong , set me right .
Sincere regard for truth is loyalty and disregard for truth is treachery .
Obey me so long as I obey God and His Messenger .
But if I disobey God and His Messenger , ye owe me no obedience .
Arise for your prayer , God have mercy upon you .
Abu Bakr 's Caliphate lasted for 27 months , during which he crushed the rebellion of the Arab tribes throughout Arabia in the successful campaign against Apostasy .
He had little time to pay attention to the administration of state , though state affairs remained stable during his Caliphate .
On the advice of Umar and Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah he agreed to have a salary from state treasury and abolish his cloth trade .
Ridda Wars Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr 's succession , threatening the unity and stability of the new community and state .
Several Arabic tribes revolted against Abu Bakr .
In four of the six centres of the insurrection , the rebels rallied around people who claimed to be prophets , the most prominent among these was Musaylimah .
The tribes claimed that they had submitted to Muhammad only , and that with Muhammad 's death , their allegiance had ended .
This was common practice in pre-Islamic Arabia .
After the death of a tribal leader the alliance with the tribe of that leader was regarded as having ended .
Thus several tribes acted in accordance to this pre-Islamic practice and refused to pay Zakat .
So , in contrast to pre-Islamic times , their allegiance was not seen as having ended at all .
This was the start of the Ridda wars ( Arabic for the Wars of Apostasy ) .
Abu Bakr planned his strategy accordingly and formed the Muslim army into 11 corps .
Other corps were given areas of secondary importance in which to bring the less dangerous apostate tribes .
After series of successful campaigns , Khalid ibn al-Walid finally defeated Musaylimah and his tribe , the Banu Hanifa , in the Battle of Yamama .
The Campaign of the Apostasy was fought and completed during the eleventh year after Hijra .
The year 12 Hijri dawned , on 18 March 633 , with Arabia united under the central authority of the Caliph at Medina .
This phenomenon was later regarded as primarily a religious movement by Arabic historians .
However , the early sources indicate that in reality it was mainly political .
After all , the revolting Arabs only refused to pay Zakat ( Charity ) , but they did not refuse to perform the salah .
The Qur ' an — preservation According to Sunni Islam , Abu Bakr was instrumental in preserving the Qur ' an in written form .
It is believed that this process happened within one year of the death of Muhammad when most of his sahaba ( companions ) were still alive .
Prior to his death , Abu Bakr gave this authorized copy of the Qur ' an to Umar – his successor .
It remained with him throughout his tenure as Caliph ( 10 years ) .
Prior to his death , Umar gave this Book to his daughter Hafsa bint Umar , who was one of the wives of Muhammad .
Later historians give Uthman Ibn Affan the principal credit for re-verification and publishing the Qur ' an .
Shi'as reject the idea that Abu Bakr or Umar were instrumental in the collection or preservation of the Qur ' an .
Military expansion Once the rebellions had been put down , Abu Bakr began a war of conquest .
Abu Bakr began with Iraq , the richest province of the Persian Empire .
He sent his most brilliant general Khalid ibn al-Walid to invade the Sassanid Empire .
Conquest of Sassanid Persian Empire Abu Bakr was strong enough to attack the Persian Empire in the north-east and the Byzantine Empire in the north-west .
There were three purposes for this conquest : 1 .
Along the borders between Arabia and these two great empires were numerous Arab tribes leading a nomadic life and forming a buffer-like state between the Persians and Romans .
Abu Bakr hoped that these tribes might accept Islam and help their brethren in spreading it .
Two gigantic empires surrounded Arabia , and it was unsafe to remain passive with these two powers on its borders .
Abu Bakr hoped that by attacking Iraq and Syria he might remove the danger from the borders of the Islamic State .
A tribal chief of north eastern Arabia , Muthanna ibn Harithah , raided the Persian towns in Iraq .
With the success of the raids , a considerable amount of booty was collected .
Muthanna ’s acts made Abu Bakr think about the expansion of the Rashidun Empire .
Abu Bakr started with the invasion of Iraq .
In return the Persian regarded the Arab with contempt .
It was important not to suffer a defeat , for that would confirm and strengthen this instinctive fear .
After defeating the self-proclaimed prophet Musaylimah in the Battle of Yamama , Khalid was still at Al-Yamama when Abu Bakr sent him orders to invade the Sassanid Empire .
In about third week of March 633 ( first week of Muharram 12th Hijrah ) Khalid set out from Al-Yamama with an army of 10,000 .
The tribal chiefs , with 2,000 warriors each , joined Khalid ; Thus Khalid entered the Persian Empire with 18,000 troops .
By now the Persian court already disturbed by the internal problems , was down and out .
In the last week of May 633 , Hira capital city of Iraq fell to the Muslims after resistance in the Siege of Hira .
Khalid then moved towards the south , and conquered the city of Ein ul Tamr after the Battle of Ein ut Tamr in the last week of July 633 .
By now , almost the whole of Iraq ( Euphrates region ) was under Islamic control .
Khalid got a call of help from northern Arabia at Daumat-ul-Jandal , where another Muslim Arab general , Ayaz bin Ghanam , was trapped among the rebel tribes .
Khalid went to Daumat-ul-jandal and defeated the rebels in the Battle of Daumat-ul-jandal in the last week of August 633 .
Returning from Arabia , he got news of the assembling of a large Persian army .
He decided to defeat them all separately to avoid the risk of defeat to a large unified Persian army .
Four divisions of Persian and Christian Arab auxiliaries were present at Hanafiz , Zumiel , Sanni and Muzieh .
Khalid devised a brilliant plan to destroy the Persian forces .
This was the last battle in his conquest of Iraq .
Invasion of Eastern Roman ( Byzantine ) Empire With a successful invasion of Sassanid Persian province of Iraq , Abu Bakr ’s confidence grew .
He concentrated four large corps at Zhu Qissah and sent them to Roman Syria .
Each corps was assigned its own commander and its own target .
The leaders of the different corps received intelligence of a concentration of large Byzantine armies at Ajnadayn while on the march .
The army stopped its advance and the leaders wrote to Abu Bakr for help .
The Byzantine province of Syria in those days consisted of modern day Syria , Jordan , Israel , the Palestinian territories , Lebanon and southern Turkey .
There were two routes towards Syria from Iraq , one was via Daumat-ul-Jandal and the other was through Mesopotamia passing though Ar Raqqah .
He also did not take the Mesopotamian route because Roman garrisons held northern Syria and northern Mesopotamia .
A conflict with these Roman forces would have forced Khalid to spend too much time while Muslim armies were being outflanked in Syria .
Khalid selected , instead , a short and unconventional route to Syria , passing though the Syrian Desert .
Khalid thus entered Northern Syria at a point where he was least expected , catching the Byzantine forces on their right flank .
More recent historians have suggested that this surprises attack unhinged the Byzantine defenses in Syria .
Khalid entered Syria in June 634 and quickly captured the border forts of Sawa , Arak , Tadmur , Sukhnah .
al-Qaryatayn and Hawarin after the battles of Qaryatayn and Hawarin .
From here he moved away from Damascus , towards Bosra , the capital of Ghassanid Arab kingdom , a vassal of Eastern Roman empire .
He had ordered other Muslim commanders to concentrate their armies at Bosra , which were still near the Syrian-Arabia border .
At Maraj-al-Rahab , Khalid defeated a Ghassanid army of Christian Arabs in a quick Battle of Marj-al-Rahit .
Meanwhile Abu Ubaida ibn al-Jarrah , the supreme commander of Muslim armies in Syria had ordered Shurhabil ibn Hasana to attack Bosra .
The latter laid siege of Bosra with his small army of 4000 men .
The combined forces of Khalid , Shurhabil and Abu Ubaidah then laid the siege of Bosra , which surrendered some time in mid July 634 .
thus effectively ending the Ghassanid Dynasty .
Here Khalid took over the command of Muslim armies in Syria from Abu Ubaidah , as per the instructions of Caliph .
The massive Byzantine armies were concentrating at Ajnadayn to push the invading armies back to desert .
According to the instructions of Khalid all Muslim corps concentrated at Ajnadayn , where they fought a decisive battle against Byzantine on 30 July 634 .
Defeat at the Battle of Ajnadayn , left Syria vulnerable to the Muslim invaders .
Khalid decided to capture Damascus , the Byzantine stronghold .
At Damascus Thomas , son in law of Emperor Heraculis , was in charge .
Receiving the intelligence of Khalid 's march towards Damascus he prepared for the defences of Damascus .
He wrote to Emperor Heraculis for reinforcement , who was at Emesa that time .
These engagements delayed Khalid ’s advance and gave Thomas enough time to prepare for siege .
Meanwhile Heraculis 's reinforcement had reached the city , which he had dispatched after the bad news of Ajnadyn .
Before Heraculis 's another regiment could reach Damascus , Khalid had finally reached Damascus .
Khalid reached Damascus on 20 August and besieged the city .
Heraculis 's reinforcement was intercepted and routed at the Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab , 20 miles from Damascus .
Khalid 's forces withstood three Roman sallies that tried to break the siege .
Khalid finally attacked and conquered Damascus on 18 September 634 after a 30-day siege .
According to some sources the siege lasted for four or six months .
Heraculis , having received the news of the fall of Damascus , left for Antioch from Emesa .
The citizens were given peace on the terms of annual tribute ; the Byzantine army was given a three-day peace to go as far as they could .
Abu Bakr died during the siege of Damascus and Umar became the new Caliph .
He dismissed his cousin Khalid ibn al-Walid from the command and appointed Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah the new commander in chief of Islamic army in Syria .
Abu Ubaidah got the letter of his appointment and Khalid 's disposal during the siege , but he delayed the announcement until the city was conquered .
Death On 23 August 634 , Abu Bakr fell sick and did not recover due to his old age .
There are two accounts about the sickness of Abu Bakr .
One account states that 8 August 634 was a cold day and when Abu Bakr took a bath , he caught a chill .
Abu Bakr developed high fever and was confined to bed .
His illness was prolonged and when his condition worsened he felt that his end was near .
Realizing his death was near , he sent for Ali and requested him to perform his ghusl since Ali had also done it for Muhammad .
He appointed Umar as his successor after discussing with some companions .
Some of them favored the nomination and others disliked it , due to the tough nature of Umar .
Aisha said that three pieces had been used .
Abu Bakr thereupon desired the same number for his own shroud .
On Monday 23 August 634 Abu Bakr died .
The funeral prayer was led by Umar .
Most of them are known by the name Siddiqui And Al-Atiqi 's Or Al-Atiqi ( Al-Ateeqi ) ( ( In Arabic ) ) .
But they are also known by some other names in different localities .
In Somalia , they are commonly known as Sheekhaal and they are well respected by other Somali clans .
In Bangladesh , they are known by the name of Qureshi .
There are also Al-Atiqi or Atiqi Families in Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Syria , Yemen , Iraq and other places in the Arabia Peninsula .
All the descendants of Abu Bakr , their Ancestors are : Abdurahman Ibn Abu Bakr and Muhammad Ibn Abu Bakr .
Legacy Abu Bakr became the Caliph on 8 June 632 and he died on 23 August 634 .
Abu Bakr had the distinction of being the first Caliph in the history of Islam and also the first Caliph to nominate a successor .
He is revered for being the first Muslim ruler to establish : He has the distinction of purchasing the land for Al-Masjid al-Nabawi .
Abu Bakr had given up drinking wine even in the time before Islam .
He was the foremost genealogist of the Quraysh and was well accomplished at interpreting dream s according to Ibn Sirin .
Abu Bakr had always been the closest friend and confidant of Muhammad throughout his life .
He was always there beside Muhammad at every major event .
It was Abu Bakr 's wisdom that Muhammad always honored .
’ During the last few weeks of his life , Muhammad preferred Abu Bakr to lead the Muslims in prayer while he was ill .
Upon Muhammad 's death , it was Abu Bakr who demonstrated sagacity to keep the ranks of the Muslims together .
Muhammad had not left behind a clear will on who would succeed him .
There was dissension between the two original tribes of Medina , namely Aws and Khazraj regarding who would become the ruler over the Muslims after Muhammad .
This even led to drawing of swords between them .
In turn , Umar declared his allegiance to Abu Bakr saying that there is no better man amongst the Muslims after Muhammad .
The majority of the sahaba ( companions of Muhammad ) assembled there followed suit and pledged their allegiance to Abu Bakr .
The famous scholar Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal also stated that he is among the foremost companions ( sahaba ) of Muhammad .
Shi'a view The Twelver Shi'a have a different view of Abu Bakr .
It is also believed that Abu Bakr and Umar conspired to take over power in the Muslim nation after Muhammad 's death , in a coup d'état against Ali .
The Twelver Shi'a criticize Abu Bakr for an alleged dispute between him and Muhammad 's daughter , Fatimah .
Furthermore , Abu Bakr had refused to grant her the lands of Fadak which Muhammad had given to her as a gift before his death .
He refused to accept the testimony of her witnesses , so she claimed the land would still belong to her as inheritance from her deceased father .
We acknowledge your superiority . "
Then he ( i.e. ' Ali ) mentioned their own relationship to Allah 's Apostle and their right .
Abu Bakr then spoke saying , " By Allah in Whose Hands my life is .
The Twelver Shi'a accuse him of participating in the burning of the house of Ali and Fatima .
( see Fadak ) .
The Zaydis and the Sunnis do not think such a thing happened .
The Twelver Shi'a believe that Abu Bakr sent Khalid ibn Walid to crush those who were in favour of Ali 's caliphate ( see Ridda Wars ) .
After the death of Abu Bakr , Ali raised Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr .
Therefore Qasim ibn Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr was the grand son of Abu Bakr the first caliph and the grand father of Jafar al-Sadiq .
Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who said anything bad about his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph .
What do you have to say on the matter of Abu Bakr and Umar ibn al-Khattab ? "
The Zaydis were also forced to convert .
Differences that existing from the Roman – Persian Wars and the Byzantine – Sassanid Wars .
For the first time in the history of Islam , the Safavids also established a hierarchical organization of the Shiite clergy and institutionalised the differences .
To have such a person as a staunch adherent of his claim , was for Muhammad a most important step .
Teach me a supplication which I may make in prayer . '
He replied : ' Say : Oh Allah !
You are Al Ghaffur , Ar-Rahim . ' "
It is reported in Sunan Abu Dawood , Ahmad , and Tirmidhi that Abu Bakr said , " O people !
You recite the verse ( 5:105 ) : " O you who believe !
When Muhammed noticed the reaction on him , he asked , " What is the matter with you ? "
Thereupon , Abu Bakr submitted , " Ya RasulAllah , there is hardly anyone among us who can claim to have done nothing bad in one 's life .
Now if every evil deed has to be requited , who can hope to go unscathed from among us ?
As it appears in another narration , he said , " O Abu Bakr , do you not get sick ?
Are you never tested by distress and sorrow ? "
Abu Bakr said , " No doubt , all this does happen . "
Then he said , " There , this is the requital of whatever evil you may have done . "

Erasmus is generally falsely credited for having coined the name ' Ambrosiaster ' ( literally in Latin : ' would be-Ambrose ' ) to describe its author .

Ambrosiaster shows a deep interest in Judaism and often notes that Christian practices derive from Jewish tradition .

He also appeared independently in the legends of the Britons , beginning with the 9th-century Historia Brittonum .
It also appears that Ambrosius was a Christian : Gildas says that he won his battles " with God 's help " .
According to Gildas , Ambrosius organised the survivors into an armed force and achieved the first military victory over the Saxon invaders .
However , this victory was not decisive : " Sometimes the Saxons and sometimes the citizens [ meaning the Romano-British inhabitants ] were victorious . "
Two points in this brief description have attracted much scholarly commentary .
The first is what Gildas meant by saying Ambrosius ' family " had worn the purple " .
Lack of information prevents sure answers to these questions .
The Historia Brittonum preserves several snippets of lore about Ambrosius .
Geoffrey also names him as one of three sons of Constantine III , along with Constans II and Uther Pendragon .
The Historia Brittonum dates the battle of Guoloph to " the twelfth year of Vortigern " , by which 437 seems to be meant .
This is perhaps a generation before the battle that Gildas says was commanded by Ambrosius Aurelianus .
In Chapter 48 Ambrosius Aurelianus is described as " king among all the kings of the British nation " .
Léon Fleuriot has suggested Ambrosius is identical to Riothamus , a Brythonic leader who fought a major battle against the Goths in France around the year 470 .
Fleuriot argues that Ambrosius led the Britons in the battle , in which he was defeated and forced to retreat to Burgundy .
He then returned to Britain to continue the war against the Saxons .
Subsequent historians accepted Myers ' speculation as fact , creating a narrative of events in 5th century Britain with various degrees of elaborate detail .
This interpretation is supported by the negative character of all of the stories retold about Vortigern in the Historia Brittonum , which include his alleged practice of incest .
( This does not fit with Gildas ' account , in which Ambrosius ' family perished in the turmoil of the Saxon uprisings . )
Later , when Vortigern 's power has faded , the two brothers return from exile with a large army , destroy Vortigern and become friends with Merlin .

In the Persian , Hellenistic , and Roman eras Little mention is made of the Ammonites through the Persian and early Hellenistic periods .
Their name appears , however , during the time of the Maccabees .

Language The few Ammonite names that have been preserved also include Nahash and Hanun , both from the Bible .
The Ammonites 's language is believed to be Semitic , closely related to Hebrew and Moabite .
Ammonite may have incorporated certain Aramaic influences , including the use of ‘ bd , instead of commoner Biblical Hebrew ‘ śh , for " work " .
Economy Like its sister-kingdom of Moab , Ammon was the source of numerous natural resources , including sandstone and limestone .
As with the Edomites and Moabites , trade along this route gave them considerable revenue .

Its capital was located in what is now the Citadel of Amman .
Ammonius Hermiae ( ; c. 440-c .
520 ) was a Greek philosopher , and the son of the Neoplatonist philosophers Hermias and Aedesia .
He was a pupil of Proclus in Athens , and taught at Alexandria for most of his life , writing commentaries on Plato , Aristotle , and other philosophers .
When they reached adulthood , Aedesia accompanied her sons to Athens where they studied under Proclus .
He was still teaching in 515 , since Olympiodorus heard him lecture on Plato 's Gorgias in that year .
He also taught Asclepius of Tralles , John Philoponus , Damascius and Simplicius .
Writings Of his reputedly numerous writings , only his commentary on Aristotle 's De Interpretatione survives intact .
A commentary on Porphyry 's Isagoge may also be his , but it is somewhat corrupt and contains later interpolations .
In De Interpretatione , Ammonius contends that divine foreknowledge makes void the contingent .
Like Boethius in his second Commentary and The Consolation of Philosophy , this argument maintains the effectiveness of prayer .
Ammonius cites Iamblichus who said knowledge is intermediate between the knower and the known , since it is the activity of the knower concerning the known .
Ammonius Saccas ( 3rd century AD ) ( ) was a Greek philosopher from Alexandria who was often referred to as one of the founders of Neoplatonism .
He is mainly known as the teacher of Plotinus , whom he taught for eleven years from 232 to 243 .
He was undoubtably the biggest influence on Plotinus in his development of Neoplatonism , although little is known about his own philosophical views .
Later Christian writers stated that Ammonius was a Christian , but it is now generally assumed that there was a different Ammonius of Alexandria who wrote biblical texts .
Life Not much is known about the life of Ammonius Saccas .
However Erich Seeberg showed that the cognomen refers to the " Śākyas " of India , the ruling clan to which Gautama Buddha also belonged .
The " Śākyas " were known in antiquity .
The cognomen " Sakkas " therefore referred to India as a marker of ethnic identity .
In this case Ammonius may have been a second-generation Indian who remained in contact with the philosophy of his ancestral country .
The intensity of commerce of goods and ideas between Alexandria and India makes this a wholly possible option .
A misreading of " Sakkas " for " sakkophoros " , being grammatically incorrect , is thus nothing but cheap polemics that stuck .
Most details of his life come from the fragments left from Porphyry 's writings .
The most famous pupil of Ammonius Saccas was Plotinus who studied under Ammonius for eleven years .
The friend , understanding the desire of his heart , sent him to Ammonius , whom he had not so far tried .
He went and heard him , and said to his friend , " This is the man I was looking for . "
According to Porphyry , the parents of Ammonius were Christians , but upon learning Greek philosophy , Ammonius rejected his parents ' religion for paganism .
when he says that ... Ammonius fell from a life of piety into heathen customs .
... Ammonius held the divine philosophy unshaken and unadulterated to the end of his life .
His works yet extant show this , as he is celebrated among many for the writings which he has left .
To add to the confusion , it seems that Ammonius had two pupils called Origen : Origen the Christian , and Origen the Pagan .
It is quite possible that Ammonius Saccas taught both Origens .
Among Ammonius ' other pupils there were Herennius and Cassius Longinus .
According to Nemesius , a bishop and Neoplatonist c. 400 , Ammonius held that the soul was immaterial .
Little is known about Ammonius 's role in the development of Neoplatonism .
The Book of Amos is a prophetic book of the Hebrew Bible , one of the Twelve Minor Prophets .
Amos lived in the kingdom of Judah but preached in the northern kingdom of Israel .
His major themes of social justice , God 's omnipotence , and divine judgment became staples of prophecy .
He was a contemporary of the prophet Hosea , but likely preceded him .
Many of the earlier accounts of prophets found in the Tanakh are found within the context of other accounts of Israel 's history .
Amos , however , is the first prophet whose name also serves as the title of the corresponding biblical book in which his story is found .
Amos also made it a point that before his calling he was a simple husbandman and that he was not a " professional " prophet of the prophetic guild .
Date Most scholars believe that Amos gave his message in the autumn of 750 BC or 749 BC .
Leading up to this time , Assyrian armies battled against Damascus for a number of years , which greatly diminished Syria 's threat to Israel .
As a result of the fighting amongst its neighbors , Israel had the benefit of increasing its borders almost to those of the time of David and Solomon .
It should also be noted that Amos preached about two years before a very large earthquake , and made reference to it twice in his book .
Zechariah ( Zechariah 14:5 b ) remembers this earthquake over 200 years later .
It is mentioned many times in the Tanakh ( Joshua 15:39 , 2 Samuel 14:9 and 23:26 , 1 Chronicles 11:28 ) .
Rehoboam is reported to have fortified Tekoa along with other cities in Judah in 2 Chronicles 11:5 -6 .
There are some differing opinions as to the location of the Tekoa Amos was presumably from .
It is believed by most that Amos was a southern farmer , called by God to deliver his prophetic message in the North .
However , some believe that Amos was actually from a Tekoa in the North , near Galilee .
Others have discredited the theory about the Galilean Tekoa , citing that the difference in elevation between the two locations is not significant .
A conspirator , they argue , is more likely to be a national .
Two other opinions of where Amos ' writings were recorded deserve mention .
They are that 1 ) disciples of Amos followed him and recorded his message and 2 ) that someone in his audience in the North recorded his message .
The wealthy elite are becoming rich at the expense of others .
Peasant farmers who once practiced subsistence farming are being forced to farm what is best for foreign trade , mostly wine and oil .
( Amos 6:6 ) God speaks to Amos , a farmer and herder , and tells him to go to Samaria , the capital of the Northern kingdom .
The people understand judgment as the coming of " the Day of the LORD . " "
The Day of the LORD " was widely celebrated and highly anticipated by the followers of God .
The Day of the Lord Amos is the first prophet to use the term " the Day of the LORD " .
This phrase becomes important within future prophetic and apocalyptic literature .
However , Amos and other prophets include Israel as an enemy of God , as Israel is guilty of injustice toward the innocent , poor , and young women .
Themes The book of Amos has three major sections plus an epilogue .
Chapters one and two look at the nations surrounding Israel and then Israel itself through an ethical lens .
Chapters three to six are a collection of verses that look more specifically at Israel 's transgressions .
Chapters seven to nine include visions that YHWH gave Amos as well as Amaziah 's rebuke of the prophet .
The last section of the book ( 7:1 to 9:8 ) , commonly referred to as the Book of Visions , contains the only narrative section .
In the first two visions , Amos is able to convince God not to act out the scenes of discipline presented to him .
This message can be seen most clearly in verse 24 of chapter five .
The plagues in the preceding chapter , chapter four , were supposed to be seen as acts of discipline that turned Israel back to God .
However , the people did not interpret the acts this way , and the discipline turned into judgment for the people 's disobedience .
The plight of Israel has become hopeless .
The nation that represents YHVH must be made pure of anything or anyone that profanes the name of God .
God 's name must be exalted .
Highlighted activities within Amos The Book of Amos contains several different key activities and genres which are used to expound upon its themes .
The following are a few examples : References Sources External links Online translations of Book of Amos :
Amphipolis ( : Amphípolis ) is a municipality in the Serres regional unit of Greece .
The seat of the municipality is Rodolivos .
In ancient times , it was a city in the region once inhabited by the Edoni people in the present-day region of Central Macedonia .
It was built on a raised plateau overlooking the east bank of the river Strymon where it emerged from Lake Cercinitis , about 3 m. from the Aegean Sea .
History Origins Archaeology has uncovered remains at the site dating to approximately 3000 BC .
Due to the strategic location of the site it was fortified from very early .
In the 8th and 7th century BC the site of Amphipolis was ruled by Illyrian tribes .
Xerxes I of Persia passed during his invasion of Greece of 480 BC and buried alive nine young men and nine maidens as a sacrifice to the river god .
Near the later site of Amphipolis Alexander I of Macedon defeated the remains of Xerxes ' army in 479 BC .
A second attempt took place in 437 BC on the same site under the guidance of Hagnon , son of Nicias .
The new settlement took the name of Amphipolis ( literally , " around the city " ) , a name which is the subject of much debates about lexicography .
However , a more probable explanation is the one given by Julius Pollux : that the name indicates the vicinity of an isthmus .
This description corresponds to the actual site of the city ( see adjacent map ) , and to the description of Thucydides .
Amphipolis subsequently became the main power base of the Athenians in Thrace and , consequently , a target of choice for their Sparta n adversaries .
The Athenian population remained very much in the minority within the city .
A new Athenian force under the command of Cleon failed once more in 422 BC during a battle at which both Cleon and Brasidas lost their lives .
Brasidas survived long enough to hear of the defeat of the Athenians and was buried at Amphipolis with impressive pomp .
From then on he was regarded as the founder of the city and honoured with yearly games and sacrifices .
The city itself kept its independence until the reign of the king Philip II despite several other Athenian attacks , notably because of the government of Callistratus of Aphidnae .
law from the gymnasium .
These ' merides ' were gradually incorporated into the Roman client state , and later province , of Thracia .
Significantly however , these churches were built within a restricted area of the town , sheltered by the walls of the acropolis .
Nevertheless , the number , size and quality of the churches constructed between the fifth and sixth centuries are impressive .
It is difficult to find reasons for such municipal extravagance in such a small town .
Amphipolis was also a diocese under the suffragan of Thessaloniki - the Bishop of Amphipolis is first mentioned in 533 .
The acropolis , the Roman baths , and especially the Episcopal basilica were crossed by this wall .
The city was probably abandoned in the eighth century , as the last bishop was attested in 787 .
This small port continued to enjoy some prosperity , before being abandoned during the Ottoman period .
However , excavations did not truly begin until after the Second World War .
In the Book of Exodus , Amram ( ) Arabic عمران Imran , is the father of Aaron , Moses , and Miriam and the husband of Jochebed .
Amram 's name changes to Imram later in the Bible .
Textual scholars attribute the biblical genealogy to the Book of Generations , a document originating from a similar group and date to the priestly source .
Biblical scholars suspect that the Elohist account offers both matrilinial and patrilinial descent from Levites in order to magnify the religious credentials of Moses .
In the Qur ' an Amran is arabicized to Imran .
In the Qur ' an , the name Imran is used for two different people .
The first one is Amram the father of Moses and the second one is Joachim the father of Mary , the mother of Jesus .
Amram , the father of Moses and Aaron , is a revered patriarch of Islam .
Through him would come many other priests and prophet s , including Anne , Elizabeth , Mary , John the Baptist and Jesus .
The text states that this recovery was opportunistically performed when a war broke out between Egypt and Canaan .
The document is dated to the 2nd century BC and , in the form of a vision , briefly discusses dualism and the Watchers : See also References
Amyntas I ( Greek : Ἀμύντας Aʹ , c. 540 – 498 BC ) was a king of Macedon .
He was a son of Alcetas I of Macedon .
He married Eurydice and they had a son Alexander .
Amyntas was a tributary vassal of Darius I , king of the Persian Achaemenid Empire .
The history of Macedon may be said to begin with Amyntas ' reign .
He was the first of its rulers to have diplomatic relations with other states .
He was also a paternal grandfather of Alexander the Great .
Reign He came to the throne after the ten years of confusion which followed the death of Archelaus I .
Medius , head of the house of the Aleuadae of Larissa , is believed to have provided aid to Amyntas in recovering his throne .
The mutual relationship between the Argeadae and the Aleuadae dates to the time of Archelaus .
To shore up his country against the threat of the Illyrians , Amyntas established an alliance with the Chalkidian League led by Olynthus .
In exchange for this support , Amyntas granted them rights to Macedonian timber , which was sent back to Athens to help fortify their fleet .
With money flowing into Olynthus from these exports , their power grew .
In response , Amyntas sought additional allies .
He established connections with Kotys , chief of the Odrysians .
Kotys had already married his daughter to the Athenian general Iphicrates .
Prevented from marrying into Kotys ' family , Amyntas soon adopted Iphicrates as his son .
After the King 's Peace 387 BC , Sparta was anxious to re-establish its presence in the north of Greece .
When Amyntas sought Spartan aid against the growing threat of Olynthus , the Spartans eagerly responded .
Amyntas thus concluded a treaty with the Spartans , who assisted him to reduce Olynthus ( 379 ) .
He also entered into a league with Jason of Pherae , and assiduously cultivated the friendship of Athens .
With Olynthus defeated , Amyntas was now able to conclude a treaty with Athens and keep the timber revenues for himself .
Amyntas shipped the timber to the house of the Athenian Timotheus , in the Piraeus .
Family By his wife Eurydice , Amyntas had three sons , Alexander II , Perdiccas III and the youngest of whom was the famous Philip II of Macedon .
Amyntas died at an advanced age , leaving his throne to his eldest son .
Reputedly a forerunner of the Cynics , none of his works have survived .
Life Anacharsis the son of Gnurus , a Scythian chief , was half Greek and from a mixed Hellenistic culture , apparently in the region of the Cimmerian Bosporus .
Solon replied , " It 's better to make friends at home . "
Thereupon the Scythian replied , " Then it is necessary for you , being at home , to make friends with me . "
Solon laughed and accepted him as his friend .
He cultivated the outsider 's knack of seeing the illogic in familiar things .
For example , Plutarch remarks that he " expressed his wonder at the fact that in Greece wise men spoke and fools decided . "
His conversation was droll and frank , and Solon and the Athenians took to him as a sage and philosopher .
His rough and free discourse became proverbial among Athenians as ' Scythian discourse ' .
Anacharsis was the first foreigner ( metic ) who received the privileges of Athenian citizenship .
Ideas None of the works ascribed to him in ancient times , if indeed they were written by him , have survived .
All that remains of his thought is what later tradition ascribes to him .
He became famous for the simplicity of his way of living and his acute observations on the institutions and customs of the Greeks .
So he became a kind of emblem to the Athenians , who inscribed on his statues : ' Restrain your tongues , your appetites , your passions . '
Come and visit me , and you will find me at peace .
You want to give me something .
But give it to your fellow-citizens instead , or let the immortal gods have it .
All of the letters are spurious .
However I will come to Sardis , as I think it very desirable to become a friend of yours .
Strabo makes him the ( probably legendary ) inventor of the anchor with two flukes , and others made him the inventor of the potter 's wheel .
It had an impact on the growth of philhellenism in France at the time .
The book went through many editions , was reprinted in the United States and translated into German and other languages .
It later inspired European sympathy for the Greek struggle for independence and spawned sequels and imitations through the 19th century .

Ānanda ( , ; Chinese : 阿難 Ānán ; Japanese : 阿難 Anan ) was one of the principal disciples and a devout attendant of the Buddha .
For that , he was known as the Guardian of the Dharma .
According to the Buddha every Buddha in the past and to come will have two chief disciples and one attendant during his ministry .
In the case of Gautama Buddha the pair of disciples were Sariputta and Mahamoggallana and the attendant Ānanda .
The word ' Ānanda ' means in Pali , Sanskrit as well as other Indian languages .
It is a popular Buddhist and Hindu name , but popular also among Muslims in Indonesia .
In the long list of the disciples given in the Anguttara Nikaya ( i. xiv . )
where each of them is declared to be the chief in some quality , Ānanda is mentioned five times ( more often than any other ) .
He was named chief in conduct , in service to others , and in power of memory .
The Buddha sometimes asked him to substitute for him as teacher and then later stated that he himself would not have presented the teachings in any other way .
The First Council Because he attended the Buddha personally and often traveled with him , Ānanda overheard and memorized many of the discourses the Buddha delivered to various audiences .
Therefore , he is often called the disciple of the Buddha who " heard much " .
Despite his long association with and close proximity to the Buddha , Ananda was only a stream-winner prior to the Buddha ’s death .
But ... Ananda will experience final liberation in this very life . "

He is often depicted with the Buddha alongside Mahakashyapa , the first Indian patriarch .
Anaxagoras ( , " lord of the assembly " ; c. 510 – 428 BCE ) was a Pre-Socratic Greek philosopher .
Born in Clazomenae in Asia Minor , Anaxagoras was the first philosopher to bring philosophy from Ionia to Athens .
According to Diogenes Laertius and Plutarch , he fled to Lampsacus due to a backlash against his pupil Pericles .
Anaxagoras is famous for introducing the cosmological concept of Nous ( mind ) , as an ordering force .
He regarded material substance as an infinite multitude of imperishable primary elements , referring all generation and disappearance to mixture and separation , respectively .
Biography Anaxagoras appears to have had some amount of property and prospects of political influence in his native town of Clazomenae in Asia Minor .
However , he supposedly surrendered both of these out of a fear that they would hinder his search for knowledge .
A sentence , denoted by Maximus , as being " possessed of sought-after wisdom ! "
Although a Greek , he may have been a soldier of the Persian army when Clazomenae was suppressed during the Ionian Revolt .
In early manhood ( c. 464 – 461 BC ) he went to Athens , which was rapidly becoming the centre of Greek culture .
There he is said to have remained for thirty years .
Pericles learned to love and admire him , and the poet Euripides derived from him an enthusiasm for science and humanity .
Anaxagoras brought philosophy and the spirit of scientific inquiry from Ionia to Athens .
His observations of the celestial bodies and the fall of meteorites led him to form new theories of the universal order .
He was the first to explain that the moon shines due to reflected light from the sun .
He also said that the moon had mountains and believed that it was inhabited .
The heavenly bodies , he asserted , were masses of stone torn from the earth and ignited by rapid rotation .
He thought that the earth is flat and floats supported by ' strong ' air under it and disturbances in this air sometimes causes earthquakes .
These speculations made him vulnerable in Athens to a charge of impiety .
About 450 BC , according to Laertius , Pericles spoke in defense of Anaxagoras at his trial .
Even so , Anaxagoras was forced to retire from Athens to Lampsacus in Troad ( c. 434 – 433 BC ) .
He died there in around the year 428 BC .
Citizens of Lampsacus erected an altar to Mind and Truth in his memory , and observed the anniversary of his death for many years .
Cosmological theory All things have existed from the beginning .
But originally they existed in infinitesimally small fragments of themselves , endless in number and inextricably combined .
All things existed in this mass , but in a confused and indistinguishable form .
Mind arranged the segregation of like from unlike ; panta chremata en omou eita nous elthon auta diekosmese .
This subtle agent , possessed of all knowledge and power , is especially seen ruling in all the forms of life .
But even after it had done its best , the original intermixture of things was not wholly overcome .
No one thing in the world is ever abruptly separated , as by the blow of an axe , from the rest of things .
Anaxagoras proceeded to give some account of the stages in the process from original chaos to present arrangements .
The division into cold mist and warm ether first broke the spell of confusion .
With increasing cold , the former gave rise to water , earth and stones .
The seeds of life which continued floating in the air were carried down with the rains and produced vegetation .
Animals , including man , sprang from the warm and moist clay .
If these things be so , then the evidence of the senses must be held in slight esteem .
Thus , Anaxagoras distrusted the senses , and gave the preference to the conclusions of reflection .
Thus , he maintained that there must be blackness as well as whiteness in snow ; how , otherwise , could it be turned into dark water ?
Anaxagoras marked a turning-point in the history of philosophy .
With him , speculation passes from the colonies of Greece to settle at Athens .
By the theory of minute constituents of things , and his emphasis on mechanical processes in the formation of order , he paved the way for the atomic theory .
Anaxarchus ( ; ; c. 380 – c. 320 BC ) was a Greek philosopher of the school of Democritus .
Together with Pyrrho , he accompanied Alexander the Great into Asia .
The reports of his philosophical views suggest that he was a forerunner of the Greek skeptics .
Life Anaxarchus was born at Abdera in Thrace .
He was the companion and friend of Alexander the Great in his Asiatic campaigns .
It is thought that he represents a link between the atomism of Democritus , and the skepticism of Pyrrho .
According to Sextus Empiricus , Anaxarchus " compared existing things to a scene-painting and supposed them to resemble the impressions experienced in sleep or madness . "
Anaxarchus is said to have praised Pyrrho 's " indifference and sang-froid . "

Anaximenes ( ) of Lampsacus ( c. 380 – 320 BC ) was a Greek rhetoric ian and historian .
Rhetorical works Anaximenes was a pupil of Zoilus and , like his teacher , wrote a work on Homer .
As a rhetorician , he was a determined opponent of Isocrates and his school .
He is generally regarded as the author of the Rhetoric to Alexander , an Art of Rhetoric included in the traditional corpus of Aristotle 's works .
Quintilian seems to refer to this work under Anaximenes ' name in Institutio Oratoria 3.4.9 , as the Italian Renaissance philologist Piero Vettori first recognized .
This attribution has , however , been disputed by some scholars .
According to Pausanias ( 6.18.6 ) , Anaximenes was " the first who practised the art of speaking extemporaneously . "
He also worked as a logographer , having written the speech prosecuting Phryne according to Diodorus Periegetes ( quoted by Athenaeus XIII .591 e ) .
The " ethical " fragments preserved in Stobaeus ' Florilegium may represent " some philosophical book . "
He was a favorite of Alexander the Great , whom he accompanied in his Persian campaigns , and wrote a third historical work on Alexander .
( However , Pausanias 6.18.6 expresses doubt about his authorship of an epic poem on Alexander . )
He was one of the eight exemplary historiographers included in the Alexandrian canon .

One of the three Milesian philosophers , he is identified as a younger friend or student of Anaximander .
Anaximenes , like others in his school of thought , practiced material monism .
This tendency to identify one specific underlying reality made up of a material thing constitutes the bulk of the contributions for which Anaximenes is most famed .

Ancus Marcius ( r. 640 BC – 616 BC ) was the legendary fourth of the Kings of Rome .
According to Festus , Marcius had the surname of Ancus from his crooked arm .
He waged war successfully against the Latins , and a number of them were settled on the Aventine Hill .
According to Livy the war was commenced by the Latins who anticipated Ancus would follow the pious pursuit of peace adopted by his grandfather , Numa Pompilius .
The Latins initially made an incursion on Roman lands .
When a Roman embassy sought restitution for the damage , the Latins gave a contemptuous reply .
Ancus accordingly declared war on the Latins .
Its residents were removed to settle on the Aventine Hill in Rome as new citizens , following the Roman traditions from wars with the Sabines and Albans .
When the other Latins subsequently occupied the empty town of Politorium , Ancus took the town again and demolished it .
The Latin villages of Tellenae and Ficana were also sacked and demolished .
The war then focused on the Latin town of Medullia .
The town had a strong garrison and was well fortified .
Several engagements took place outside the town and the Romans were eventually victorious .
Ancus returned to Rome with much booty .
On the land side of the city he constructed the Fossa Quiritium , a ditch fortification .
He also built Rome 's first prison , the Mamertine prison .
He expanded the temple of Jupiter Feretrius to reflect these territorial successes .
According to a reconstruction of the Fasti Triumphales , Ancus Marcius celebreated at least one triumph , over the Sabines and Veientes .
Ancus Marcius was succeeded by Lucius Tarquinius Priscus who was killed by the sons of Ancus Marcius .
Patrician Marcius Rex - family descended from this king and remained prominent during the republic and empire .
History Early inhabitants The Andaman islands have been inhabited for several thousand years , at the very least .
The indigenous Andamanese people appear to have lived on the islands in substantial isolation from that time until the 18th century CE .
Traveler reports The name of the Andaman Islands is ancient .
The name first appears in the work of Arab geographers of the 9th century ( Soleyman in 851 ) .
It is possible that ancient geographers like Ptolemy also knew of the Andamans but referred to them by a different name .
The book also mentions an island he called Andaman al-Kabir ( Great Andaman ) .
The Andaman and Nicobar islands are called Timaittivu ( " impure islands " in Tamil ) in Chola Dynasty chronicles .
Another Italian traveler , Niccolò de ' Conti ( c. 1440 ) , mentioned the islands and said that the name means " Island of Gold " .
Chola Empire From 800 to 1200 AD , the Tamil Chola Dynasty created an empire that eventually extended from southeastern peninsular India to parts of Malaysia .
Maratha empire The Maratha admiral Kanhoji Angre used the Andamans as a base and " fought the British off these islands until his death in 1729 . "
British Colonization and Penal Colony In 1789 , the government of Bengal established a naval base and penal colony on Chatham Island in the southeast bay of Great Andaman .
The settlement is now known as Port Blair ( after the Bombay Marine lieutenant Archibald Blair who founded it ) .
After two years , the colony was moved to the northeast part of Great Andaman and was named Port Cornwallis after Admiral William Cornwallis .
However , there was much disease and death in the penal colony and the government ceased operating it in May 1796 .
In 1824 , Port Cornwallis was the rendezvous of the fleet carrying the army to the First Burmese War .
In the 1830s and 1840s , shipwrecked crews who landed on the Andamans were often attacked and killed by the natives , alarming the British government .
In 1855 , the government proposed another settlement on the islands , including a convict establishment , but the Indian Rebellion of 1857 forced a delay in its construction .
However , because the rebellion gave the British so many prisoners , it made the new Andaman settlement and prison urgently necessary .
In 1867 , the ship Nineveh wrecked on the reef of North Sentinel Island .
The 86 survivors reached the beach in the ship 's boats .
On the third day , they were attacked with iron-tipped spears by naked islanders .
One person from the ship escaped in a boat .
For some time , sickness and mortality were high , but swamp reclamation and extensive forest clearance continued .
In the same year , the two island groups Andaman and Nicobar , were united under a chief commissioner residing at Port Blair .
A notable prisoner there was Vinayak Damodar Savarkar .
The number of prisoners who died in this camp is estimated to be in the thousands .
Many more died of harsh treatment and the harsh living and working conditions in this camp .
The Viper Chain Gang Jail on Viper Island was reserved for troublemakers , and was also the site of hangings .
In the 20th century , it became a convenient place to house prominent members of India 's independence movement .
Japanese occupation The Andaman and Nicobar islands were occupied by Japan during World War II .
The islands were nominally put under the authority of the Arzi Hukumat-e-Azad Hind ( Provisional Government of Free India ) headed by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose .
Netaji visited the islands during the war , and renamed them as Shaheed ( Martyr ) & Swaraj ( Self-rule ) .
On 30 December 1943 , during the Japanese occupation , Subhas Chandra Bose , who was controversially allied with the Japanese , first raised the flag of Indian independence .
General Loganathan , of the Indian National Army , was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands , which had been annexed to the Provisional Government .
Before leaving the islands , the Japanese rounded up and executed 750 civilians .
After the end of the war the islands briefly returned to British control , before becoming part of the newly independent state of India .
At the close of the World War II , the British government announced its intention to abolish the penal settlement .
The government proposed to employ former inmates in an initiative to develop the island 's fisheries , timber , and agricultural resources .
In exchange inmates would be granted return passage to the Indian mainland , or the right to settle on the islands .
The penal colony was eventually closed on 15 August 1947 when India gained independence .
It has since served as a museum to the independence movement .
With a crew of international professional surfers , they crossed the Andaman Sea on the yacht Crescent and cleared formalities in Port Blair .
The resulting article in SURFER Magazine , " Quest for Fire " by journalist Sam George , put the Andaman Islands on the surfing map for the first time .
Callahan went on to make several more surfing projects in the Andamans , including a trip to the Nicobar Islands in 1999 .
On 26 December 2004 , the coast of the Andaman Islands was devastated by a high tsunami following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake .
Strong oral traditions in the area warned of the importance of moving inland after a quake and is credited with saving many lives .
In the aftermath , more than 2,000 people were confirmed dead and more than 4,000 children were orphaned or had lost one parent .
At least 40,000 residents were rendered homeless and were moved to relief camps .
On 11 August 2009 , a magnitude 7 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands , causing a tsunami warning to go into effect .
On 30 March 2010 , a magnitude 6.9 earthquake struck near the Andaman Islands .
Geography The Andaman Archipelago is an oceanic continuation of the Burmese Arakan Yoma range in the North and of the Indonesian Archipelago in the South .
It has 325 islands which cover an area of , with the Andaman Sea to the east between the islands and the coast of Burma .
North Andaman Island is south of Burma , although a few smaller Burmese islands are closer , including the three Coco Islands .
The Ten Degree Channel separates the Andamans from the Nicobar Islands to the south .
The highest point is located in North Andaman Island ( Saddle Peak at ) .
The climate is typical of tropical islands of similar latitude .
It is always warm , but with sea-breezes .
Rainfall is irregular , but usually dry during the north-east , and very wet during the south-west , monsoons .
Flora The Middle Andamans harbour mostly moist deciduous forests .
North Andamans is characterized by the wet evergreen type , with plenty of woody climbers .
The natural vegetation of the Andamans is tropical forest , with mangrove s on the coast .
The rainforests are similar in composition to those of the west coast of Burma .
Most of the forests are evergreen , but there are areas of deciduous forest on North Andaman , Middle Andaman , Baratang and parts of South Andaman Island .
The South Andaman forests have a profuse growth of epiphytic vegetation , mostly ferns and orchids .
The Andaman forests are largely unspoiled , despite logging and the demands of the fast-growing population driven by immigration from the Indian mainland .
Threats to wildlife come from introduced species including rats , dogs , cats and the elephants of Interview Island and North Andaman .
Timber Andaman forests contain 200 or more timber producing species of trees , out of which about 30 varieties are considered to be commercial .
Major commercial timber species are Gurjan ( Dipterocarpus spp . )
and Padauk ( Pterocarpus dalbergioides ) .
The following ornamental woods are noted for their pronounced grain formation : Padauk wood is sturdier than teak and is widely used for furniture making .
There are burr wood and buttress root formations in Andaman Padauk .
The largest piece of buttress known from Andaman was a dining table of .
The largest piece of burr wood was again a dining table for eight .
The holy Rudraksha ( Elaeocarps sphaericus ) and aromatic Dhoop resin trees also are found here .
Fauna The Andaman islands are home to a number animals , many of them endemic .
This population has been subject to research studies .
The government has been criticized for failing to inform tourists of the crocodile sanctuary and danger , while simultaneously promoting tourism .
Crocodiles are not only found within the sanctuary , but throughout the island chain in varying densities .
They are habitat restricted , so the population is stable but not large .
Populations occur throughout available mangrove habitat on all major islands , including a few creeks on Havelock .
The species uses the ocean as a means of travel between different rivers and estuaries , thus they are not as commonly observed in open ocean .
Demographics The population of the Andaman was 343,125 in 2011 , having grown from 50,000 in 1960 .
The bulk of the population originates from immigrants who came to the island since the colonial times , mainly of Bengali , Hindustani and Tamil backgrounds .
Presently , there remain only approximately 400 – 450 indigenous Andamanese .
The Jangil were soon extinct .
The Onge are reduced to less than 100 people .
Only the Jarawa and Sentinelese still maintain a steadfast independence and refuse most attempts at contact ; their numbers are uncertain but estimated to be in the low hundreds .
Government Port Blair is the chief community on the islands , and the administrative centre of the Union Territory .
The magistrate in Lady Gregory 's play Spreading the News had formerly served in the islands .
A principal character in the book " Six Suspects " ( ISBN 0-385-60815-2 ) by Vikas Swarup is from the Andaman Islands .
Transportation The only airport in the islands is Vir Savarkar Airport in Port Blair , which has scheduled services to Kolkata and Chennai and Delhi , Banglore and Bhubaneswar .
The airport is under control of the Indian Navy .
Only Daytime flying is allowed .
Fares are high during peak seasons of spring and winter , but fares have been decreased over the time due to large expansion of aviation industry in India .
Alexander Anderson ( c. 1592 , Aberdeen – c. 1620 , Paris ) was a Scottish mathematician .
He was the son of David Anderson of Finshaugh .
His sister was Janet Anderson , the mother of the celebrated James Gregory .
He was selected by the executors of Vieta to revise and edit Viete 's manuscript works .
Andocides or Andokides ( , 440 – 390 BC ) was a logographer ( speech writer ) in Ancient Greece .
He was one of the ten Attic orators included in the " Alexandrian Canon " compiled by Aristophanes of Byzantium and Aristarchus of Samothrace in the third century BC .
He was implicated during the Peloponnesian War in the mutilation of the Herms on the eve of the departure of the Athenian expedition against Sicily in 415 BC .
Although he saved his life by turning informer , he was condemned to partial loss of civil rights and forced to leave Athens .
In 391 BC he was one of the ambassadors sent to Sparta to discuss peace terms , but the negotiations failed .
Oligarch ical in his sympathies , he offended his own party and was distrusted by the democrats .
Andocides was no professional orator ; his style is simple and lively , natural but inartistic .

Born and generally active in Mantua about 1540 ( Brulliot says 1560 ) and died at Rome in 1623 .
His engravings are scarce and valuable , and are chiefly copies of Mantegna , Albrecht Dürer , Parmigianino and Titian .
He was active 1584-1610 in Florence .
Andrew II the Jerosolimitan ( Hungarian : Jeruzsálemi II András / Endre , Ukrainian : Андрій II , Croatian : Andrija II .
Arpadović , Slovak : Ondrej II .
He was the younger son of King Béla III of Hungary , who invested him with the government of the Principality of Halych .
However , the boyars of Halych rebelled against his rule and expelled the Hungarian troops .
Following their father 's death , Andrew continuously conspired against his brother , King Emeric of Hungary who had to grant him the government of Croatia and Dalmatia .
When his brother and his infant son died , Andrew ascended the throne and started to grant royal domains to his partisans .
He participated in the Fifth Crusade but he could not achieve any major military success .
He was the first Hungarian king who introduced the feudal system in Kingdom of Hungary .
During his long reign , the central power and royal authority potentially weakened .
He had several quarrels with his sons .
The turbulent duke Andrew was the second son of King Béla III and his first wife , Agnes of Antioch .
The child Andrew 's rule in Halych must have been only nominal ; he did not even visit his principality .
However , Andrew used the money to recruit followers among the barons and also sought the assistance of Leopold VI , Duke of Austria .
In December 1197 , Andrew 's troops defeated King Emeric 's armies in a battle near to Macsek in December 1197 .
Following Andrew 's victory , the king was obliged to transfer the government of the Duchies of Croatia and Dalmatia to Andrew .
In the beginning of 1198 , Pope Innocent III requested that Andrew fulfill his father 's last wishes and lead a Crusade to the Holy Land .
However , instead of a Crusade , Andrew led a campaign against the neighbouring provinces and occupied Zahumlje and Rama .
In the summer of 1199 , King Emeric defeated Andrew in the Battle of Rád and Andrew had to flee to Austria .
Finally , the two brothers made peace with the mediation of the Papal Legate Gregory , and the king granted rule of Croatia and Dalmatia again to his brother .
Around 1200 , Andrew married Gertrude , a daughter of Berthold IV , Duke of Merania .
The king had his brother arrested , but Andrew managed to escape shortly afterwards .
Nevertheless , the king whose health was failing , wanted to secure the ascension of his young son , Ladislaus , who had been crowned on 26 August 1204 .
Shortly afterwards , the king reconciled with Andrew whom he appointed to govern the kingdom during his son 's minority .
The Dowager Queen Constance was anxious for her son 's life and she escaped with King Ladislaus to the court of Leopold VI , Duke of Austria .
Andrew made preparations for a war against Austria , but the child king died on 7 May 1205 , thus Andrew inherited the throne .
Novæ institutiones Andrew was crowned by Archbishop John of Kalocsa on 29 May 1205 in Székesfehérvár , but before the coronation , he had to take an oath .
Andrew made a radical alteration in the internal policy followed by his predecessors and he began to bestow the royal estates to his partisans .
He gave away everything – money , villages , domains , whole counties – to the utter impoverishment of the treasury .
Andrew was generous primarily with his wife 's German relatives and followers , which caused discontent among his subjects .
Struggles for Halych During the first years of his reign , Andrew was occupied with the discords within the Principality of Halych .
In 1205 , he led his armies to the principality to ensure the rule of the child Prince Danylo .
Following his campaign , he adopted the title of " King of Galicia and Lodomeria " referring to his supremacy over the two neighbouring principalities .
Nevertheless , in the same year , he made a campaign in Halych and gave assistance to Prince Roman Igorevych to acquire the throne .
In 1211 , he granted the Burzenland to the Teutonic Knights in order to ensure the security of the southeastern borders of his kingdom against the Cumans .
However , the Teutonic Knights began to establish a country independent of the King of Hungary .
In 1211 , Andrew provided military assistance to Prince Danylo to reoccupy Halych .
Moreover , in the following year , Andrew lead his armies personally to Halych to repulse the attack of Prince Mstilav of Peresopnytsia against Prince Danylo .
Shortly afterwards , Prince Danylo , was obliged to leave his country and he sought again Andrew 's assistance .
Nevertheless , in 1214 , Andrew had his son crowned .
Their allied troops occupied the neighbouring principality which was granted to Andrew 's younger son , Coloman .
Shortly afterwards , Andrew made an alliance again with Leszek I and they occupied Halych where again Andrew 's son was appointed to prince .
The Fifth Crusade In the meantime , Andrew began to deal with the problems of the southern borders of his kingdom .
In 1214 , the Hungarian troops annexed Belgrade and Braničevo from the Bulgarian Empire .
In February 1215 , Andrew married Yolanda , the niece of Henry I , the Emperor of Constantinople .
Nevertheless , Andrew decided to fulfill his father 's oath and made preparations for a Crusade .
Andrew and his troops embarked on 23 August 1217 in Spalato ( Split ) .
Andrew appointed Pontius de Cruce , Master of the Order in the Hungarian Kingdom , as a regent in Croatia and Dalmatia .
They landed on 9 October on Cyprus from where they sailed to Acre .
The well-mounted army defeated sultan Al-Adil I ( Sultan of Egypt ) in Bethsaida at Jordan River on 10 November .
Muslim forces retreated in their fortress and towns .
The catapults and trebuchets did n't arrive on time , so he had fruitless assaults on the fortresses of the Lebanon and on Mount Tabor .
Afterwards , Andrew spent his time collecting alleged relics .
Andrew set home on ( 18 January 1218 ) .
When he was staying in Nicaea , his cousins , who had been living there , made an unsuccessful attempt to take his life .
When King Andrew II , having fulfilled his Crusader vow , took his troops northward , he proceeded through Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia .
There King Andrew II arranged a marriage between his son , Andrew , and Levon 's daughter , Isabelle .
The Golden Bull and the Diploma Andreanum On his return , he found its kingdom in anarchy .
His foreign policy was also a total failure .
In August 1219 , his younger son , Coloman , who had been crowned King of Halych , was expelled from his kingdom by Prince Mstilav of Novgorod .
Andrew had to make peace with the Prince of Novgorod and he also engaged his youngest son , Andrew with one of his opponent 's daughter .
In 1220 , Andrew entrusted the government of Slavonia , Dalmatia and Croatia to his son , Béla .
Andrew also enforced Béla to separate from his wife .
In 1223 , the junior King Béla IV took back his wife and escaped to Austria fearing of Andrew 's anger .
On 6 June 1224 Andrew made a peace with Duke Leopold VI of Austria .
In 1224 , Andrew issued the Diploma Andreanum which unified and ensured the special privileges of the Transylvanian Saxons .
It 's considered the oldest Autonomy law in the world .
In the same year , Andrew expelled the Teutonic Knights from Transylvania because they had ignored his overlordship .
Andrew opposed his son 's policy and he entrusted Béla with the government of Transylvania while his younger son , Coloman became the governor of Béla 's former provinces .
In the second half of 1226 , Andrew lead his armies to Halych on the request of his youngest son , Andrew .
Although , Prince Mstilav defeated the royal armies , but finally he agreed to cede the government of the principality to the Hungarian prince .
Therefore , Pope Gregory IX requested him to give up this practice .
In the second half of 1231 , Andrew led his armies to Halych and managed to ensure his youngest son 's rule in the principality .
Because of the new marriage , his relationship with his sons worsened .
In the summer of 1234 , the Bishop John of Bosnia excommunicated Andrew because he had not respected some provisions of the Agreement of Bereg .
Andrew appealed to the Pope against the bishop 's measure .
In the autumn of 1234 , Prince Danylo laid siege to the capital of Andrew 's youngest son who died during the siege .
Thus , the Hungarian supremacy over Halych disappeared .
In the beginning of 1235 , Andrew made a campaign against Austria and enforced Duke Frederick II to make a peace .
He was still alive when one of his daughters , Elisabeth , who had died some years before , was canonized on 28 May 1235 .

An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding is a book by the Scottish empiricist philosopher David Hume , published in 1748 .
It was a revision of an earlier effort , Hume 's A Treatise of Human Nature , published anonymously in London in 1739 – 40 .
The end product of his labours was the Enquiry .
The Enquiry dispensed with much of the material from the Treatise , in favor of clarifying and emphasizing its most important aspects .
For example , Hume 's views on personal identity do not appear .
However , more vital propositions , such as Hume 's argument for the role of habit in a theory of knowledge , are retained .
This book has proven highly influential , both in the years that would immediately follow and today .
Immanuel Kant points to it as the book which woke him from his self-described " dogmatic slumber " .
The Enquiry is widely regarded as a classic in modern philosophical literature .
Summary The argument of the Enquiry proceeds by a series of incremental steps , separated into chapters which logically succeed one another .
After expounding his epistemology , Hume explains how to apply his principles to specific topics .
Of the different species of philosophy In the first section of the Enquiry , Hume provides a rough introduction to philosophy as a whole .
The latter investigates both actions and thoughts .
However , he insists , precision helps art and craft of all kinds , including the craft of philosophy .
Of the origin of ideas Next , Hume discusses the distinction between impressions and ideas .
By " impressions " , he means sensations , while by " ideas " , he means memories and imaginings .
According to Hume , the difference between the two is that ideas are less vivacious than impressions .
For example , the idea of the taste of an orange is far inferior to the impression ( or sensation ) of actually eating one .
Writing within the tradition of empiricism , he argues that impressions are the source of all ideas .
Hume accepts that ideas may be either the product of mere sensation , or of the imagination working in conjunction with sensation .
According to Hume , the creative faculty makes use of ( at least ) four mental operations which produce imaginings out of sense-impressions .
( Hume 1974:317 ) In a later chapter , he also mentions the operations of mixing , separating , and dividing .
( Hume 1974:340 ) However , Hume admits that there is one objection to his account : the problem of " The Missing Shade of Blue " .
In this thought-experiment , he asks us to imagine a man who has experienced every shade of blue except for one ( see Fig. 1 ) .
He predicts that this man will be able to divide the color of this particular shade of blue , despite the fact that he has never experienced it .
( Hume 1974:319 ) 3 .
Of the association of ideas In this chapter , Hume discusses how thoughts tend to come in sequences , as in trains of thought .
He explains that there are at least three kinds of associations between ideas : resemblance , contiguity in space-time , and cause-and-effect .
He argues that there must be some universal principle that must account for the various sorts of connections that exist between ideas .
However , he does not immediately show what this principle might be .
( Hume 1974:320 -321 ) 4 .
The former , he tells the reader , are proved by demonstration , while the latter are given through experience .
For Hume , every effect only follows its cause arbitrarily — they are entirely distinct from one another .
( Hume 1974:330 -332 ) Here he is describing what would become known as the problem of induction .
This is also , presumably , the " principle " that organizes the connections between ideas .
Indeed , one of the many famous passages of the Inquiry was on the topic of the incorrigibility of human custom .
In a later chapter , he wrote : In the second part , he provides an account of beliefs .
He explains that the difference between belief and fiction is that the former produces a certain feeling of confidence which the latter does n't .
( Hume 1974:340 ) 6 .
Of probability This short chapter begins with the notions of probability and chance .
For him , " probability " means a higher chance of occurring , and brings about a higher degree of subjective expectation in the viewer .
By " chance " , he means all those particular comprehensible events which the viewer considers possible in accord with their experience .
However , further experience takes these equal chances , and forces the imagination to observe that certain chances arise more frequently than others .
These gentle forces upon the imagination cause the viewer to have strong beliefs in outcomes .
This effect may be understood as another case of custom or habit taking past experience and using it to predict the future .
( Hume 1974:346 -348 ) Applied epistemology 7 .
He rejects the notion that any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined , since that would mean we could know something prior to experience .
( Hume 1974:353 -354 ) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone .
In this way , people know of necessity through rigorous custom or habit , and not from any immediate knowledge of the powers of the will .
( Hume 1974:361 ) He then produces three explanations for how we account for causation : 8 .
He first shows that it is clear that most events are deterministic , but human actions are more controversial .
However , he thinks that these too occur out of necessity since an outside observer can see the same regularity that he would in a purely physical system .
He then shows ( quite briefly ) how determinism and free will are compatible notions , and have no bad consequences on ethics or moral life .
He believed that animals were able to infer the relation between cause and effect in the same way that humans do : through learned expectations .
( Hume 1974:384 ) He also notes that this " inferential " ability that animals have is not through reason , but custom alone .
Hume concludes that there is an innate faculty of instincts which both beasts and humans share , namely , the ability to reason experimentally ( through custom ) .
( Hume 1974:385 , footnote 17 . )
This was not an idle concern for Hume .
Depending on its outcome , the entire treatment would give the epistemologist a degree of certitude in the treatment of miracles .
Needless to say , these reasons are only to be trusted to the extent that they conform to experience .
( Hume 1974:389 ) And there are a number of reasons to be skeptical of human testimony , also based on experience .
Hume understands a miracle to be any event which contradicts the laws of nature .
( Hume 1974:391 -392 ) Moreover , he stresses that talk of the miraculous has no surface validity , for four reasons .
First , he explains that in all of history there has never been a miracle which was attested to by a wide body of disinterested experts .
Second , he notes that human beings delight in a sense of wonder , and this provides a villain with an opportunity to manipulate others .
Third , he thinks that those who hold onto the miraculous have tended towards barbarism .
However , he seems to suggest that historians are as fallible at interpreting the facts as the rest of humanity .
( Hume 1974:400 -402 ) 11 .
Of a particular providence and of a future state Hume continues his application of epistemology to theology by an extended discussion on heaven and hell .
Hume seems essentially persuaded by his friend 's reasoning .
( Hume 1974:412 -414 ) 12 .
Of the academical or skeptical philosophy ( in three parts ) The first section of the last chapter is well organized as an outline of various skeptical arguments .
The treatment includes the arguments of atheism , Cartesian skepticism , " light " skepticism , and rationalist critiques of empiricism .
He ends the section with his own reservations towards Cartesian and Lockean epistemologies .
In the second section he returns to the topic of hard skepticism by sharply denouncing it .
He concludes the volume by setting out the limits of knowledge once and for all . "
When we run over libraries , persuaded of these principles , what havoc must we make ?
Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence ?
Commit it then to the flames : for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion . "
The " custom " view of learning can in many ways be likened to associationist psychology .
This point of view has been subject to severe criticism in the research of the 20th century .
Still , testing on the subject has been somewhat divided .
Testing on certain animals like cats have concluded that they do not possess any faculty which allow their minds to grasp an insight into cause and effect .
Well acquainted with the Middle-East , he spoke Arabic and " Chaldean " ( thought to be either Syriac or Persian ) .
Andrew was accompanied on this mission by brother Jacques .
Papal Mission to the Mongols ( 1245 – 1247 ) Andrew of Longjumeau led one of four missions dispatched to the Mongols by Pope Innocent IV .
He left Lyon in the spring of 1245 for the Levant .
He visited Muslim principalities in Syria and representatives of the Nestorian and Jacobite churches in Persia , finally delivering the papal correspondence to a Mongol general near Tabriz .
Their route led them through Persia , along the southern and eastern shores of the Caspian Sea , and certainly through Talas , north-east of Tashkent .
But it is certain that before the friar had quit " Tartary " Möngke , Güyük 's successor , had been elected .
Mounds of bones marked his road , witnesses of devastations which other historians record in detail .
Death Andrew died some time after 1253 , while he was active as a missionary in Palestine .
We only know of Andrew through references in other writers : see especially William of Rubruck 's in Recueil de voyages , iv .

In 168 BC , the Romans invaded Macedonia and overthrew the king , Perseus , in the First Battle of Pydna .
As his first attempt , Andriskos travelled to Syria to request military help from Demetrius Soter of Syria .
Demetrius instead handed him over to the Romans .
Andriskos escaped from Roman captivity , and raised a Thracian army .
With this army , he invaded Macedonia and defeated the Roman praetor Publius Juventius in 149 BC .
Andriskos then declared himself King Philip VI of Macedonia .
In 148 BC , Andriskos conquered Thessaly and made an alliance with Carthage , thus bringing the Roman wrath on him .
Andriscus 's brief reign over Macedonia was marked by cruelty and extortion .
After this Macedonia was formally reduced to a Roman province .
Andronikos III was the son of Michael IX Palaiologos and Rita of Armenia ( renamed Maria ) .
His maternal grandparents were King Levon II of Armenia and Queen Keran of Armenia .
Life Andronikos was born in Constantinople on his grandfather 's 38th birthday .
In 1320 , Andronikos accidentally caused the death of his brother Manuel , whereupon their father died of grief .
The elder Andronikos disowned his grandson , whereupon Andronikos III fled the capital and rallied his supporters around him in Thrace .
Effective administrative authority during the reign of Andronikos III was wielded by his megas domestikos John Kantakouzenos , while the Emperor enjoyed himself hunting or waging war .
Peace with Bulgaria was secured through territorial concessions and a diplomatic marriage between the children of the two emperors .
After that , only Philadelpheia and a handful of ports remained under Byzantine control in Asia Minor .
However , this did little to stem the Ottoman advance in Asia Minor .
Under Stefan Uroš IV Dušan , Serbia expanded into Byzantine territory in Macedonia , taking Ohrid , Prilep , Kastoria , Strumica , and Edessa in about 1334 .
The one-time governor of Thessalonica , Syrgiannes Palaeologos , had deserted to the side of the Serbians and aided their advance in to Macedonia .
The Serbs , led by Syrgiannes , advanced as far as Thessalonica , but there Syrgiannes was betrayed and killed the by the Byzantine general Sphrantzes Palaiologos .
This brought the Serbian army into disarray .
Despite these troubles Andronikos III secured the extension of Byzantine control over Thessaly in 1333 and Epirus in 1337 , by taking advantage of succession crises in these principalities .
In retrospect his reign may be said to end before the situation of the Byzantine Empire became untenable .
The Muslim traveller Ibn Battuta , who visited Constantinople towards the end of 1332 , mentions in his memoirs having met Andronikos III .
This is not attested in Byzantine sources .
Nicaea , until 1261 the capital of the Empire , was under siege by Ottoman Turks .
Andronikos III died at Constantinople , aged 44 , in 1341 .
Family Andronikos III was first married , in 1318 , with Irene of Brunswick , daughter of Henry I , Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg ; she died in 1324 .
They had an unnamed son , who died shortly after birth in 1321 .
Andronikos III married as his second wife , in 1326 , with Anna of Savoy .
She was a daughter of Count Amadeus V , Count of Savoy and his second wife Maria of Brabant .
They had several children , including : According to Nicephorus Gregoras , Andronikos also had an illegitimate daughter , Irene Palaiologina of Trebizond .
She married Basil of Trebizond and took over the throne of the Empire of Trebizond from 1340 to 1341 .
She was reportedly one of several wives of Uzbeg Khan of the Golden Horde .
Ancestry Legacy Under Andronikos the Byzantine Empire came closest to regaining a position of power in the Balkan Peninsula since the Fourth Crusade .
Although an energetic campaigner , the empire during this period was just too weak to defeat its enemies in Anatolia , Bulgaria and Serbia .
Andronikos II Palaiologos ( ) ( 25 March 1259 – 13 February 1332 ) , Latinized as Andronicus II Palaeologus , was Byzantine emperor from 1282 to 1328 .
He was the eldest surviving son of Michael VIII Palaiologos and Theodora Doukaina Vatatzina , grandniece of John III Doukas Vatatzes .
On 8 November 1273 , Andronikos II married Anne of Hungary ( 1260 – 1281 ) , daughter of the king Stephen V of Hungary .
Life Andronikos II Palaiologos was born at Nicaea .
He was acclaimed co-emperor in 1261 , after his father Michael VIII recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire , but he was crowned only in 1272 .
In 1291 , he hired 50 – 60 Genoese ships .
Later , in 1320 , he tried to resurrect the navy by constructing 20 galleys , but failed .
Andronikos II Palaiologos sought to resolve some of the problems facing the Byzantine Empire through diplomacy .
Andronikos II had resettled those Cretans in the region of Meander river , the southeastern Asia Minor frontier of Byzantium with the Turks .
In spite of some successes , the Catalans were unable to secure lasting gains .
There they conquered the Duchy of Athens and Thebes .
The Turks continued to penetrate the Byzantine possessions , and Prusa fell in 1326 .
By the end of Andronikos II 's reign , much of Bithynia was in the hands of the Ottoman Turks of Osman I and his son and heir Orhan .
Also , Karasids conquered Mysia - region with Paleokastron after 1296 , Germiyan conquered Simav in 1328 , Saruhan captured Magnesia in 1313 and Aydinids captured Symirna in 1310 .
The Empire 's problems were exploited by Theodore Svetoslav of Bulgaria , who defeated Michael IX and conquered much of northeastern Thrace in c. 1305 – 1307 .
The conflict ended with yet another dynastic marriage , between Michael IX 's daughter Theodora and the Bulgarian emperor .
The conflict precipitated Bulgarian involvement , and Michael Asen III of Bulgaria attempted to capture Andronikos II under the guise of sending him military support .
In 1328 Andronikos III entered Constantinople in triumph and Andronikos II was forced to abdicate .
He died as a monk at Constantinople in 1332 .
Andronikos I Komnenos ( or Andronicus I Comnenus , ; c. 1118 – September 12 , 1185 ) was Byzantine Emperor from 1183 to 1185 ) .
He was the son of Isaac Komnenos and grandson of Emperor Alexios I Komnenos .
Biography Early years Andronikos Komnenos was born early in the 12th century , around 1118 .
Andronikos ' early years were spent alternately in pleasure and in military service .
In 1141 he was taken captive by the Seljuq Turks and remained in their hands for a year .
Here the charms of his niece , Eudoxia , attracted him and she became his mistress .
In 1152 , accompanied by Eudoxia , he set out for an important command in Cilicia .
Failing in his principal enterprise , an attack upon Mopsuestia , he returned , but was again appointed to the command of a province .
About this time ( 1153 ) a conspiracy against the Emperor , in which Andronikos participated , was discovered and he was thrown into prison .
There he remained for about twelve years , during which time he made repeated but unsuccessful attempts to escape .
Exile At last , in 1165 , he was successful in escaping .
After passing through many dangers , including captivity in Vlachs territory , he reached the court of his cousin Yaroslav Osmomysl of Galicia .
While under the protection of Yaroslav , Andronikos brought about an alliance between him and the Emperor Manuel I , and so restored himself to the emperor 's favour .
With a Galician army he joined Manuel in the invasion of Hungary and assisted at the siege of Semlin .
He was removed from court , but received the province of Cilicia .
Being still under the displeasure of the Emperor , Andronikos fled to the court of Raymond , prince of Antioch .
While residing here he captivated and seduced the beautiful daughter of the prince , Philippa , sister of the Empress Maria .
The anger of the Emperor was again roused by this dishonour , and Andronikos was compelled to flee .
He took refuge with King Amalric I of Jerusalem , whose favour he gained , and who invested him with the Lordship of Beirut .
In Jerusalem he saw Theodora Komnene , the beautiful widow of King Baldwin III and niece of the Emperor Manuel .
Although Andronikos was at that time fifty-six years old , age had not diminished his charms , and Theodora became the next victim of his artful seduction .
They were well received by the king , George III of Georgia , whose anonymous sister had probably been Andronikos ’ first wife .
Andronikos was granted estates in Kakhetia , in the east of Georgia .
Finally , Andronikos and Theodora settled in the ancestral lands of the Komnenoi at Oinaion , on the shores of the Black Sea , between Trebizond and Sinope .
To obtain their release Andronikos in early 1180 made abject submission to the Emperor and , appearing in chains before him , besought pardon .
This he obtained , and was allowed to retire with Theodora into banishment at Oinaion .
Emperor In 1180 the Emperor Manuel died and was succeeded by his ten-year-old son Alexios II , who was under the guardianship of his mother , Empress Maria .
The poisoner was said to be the eunuch Pterygeonites .
Andronikos , now ( 1183 ) sole emperor , married twelve-year-old Agnes of France , previously betrothed to Alexios II .
Agnes was a daughter of King Louis VII of France and his third wife Adèle of Champagne .
By November 1183 , Andronikos associated his younger legitimate son John Komnenos on the throne .
A Venetian embassy visited Constantinople in 1184 and an agreement was reached that compensation of 1,500 gold pieces would be paid for the losses incurred in 1171 .
His short reign was characterized by strong and harsh measures .
He resolved to suppress many abuses , but above all things , to check feudalism and limit the power of the nobles , who were rivals for his throne .
The aristocrats in turn were infuriated against him .
There were several revolts , the stories of chaos leading to an invasion by King William of the Norman Sicilians .
Andronikos also assembled a fleet of 100 ships to stop the Norman fleet from entering the Sea of Marmara .
The invaders were finally driven out in 1186 by his successor , Isaac Angelos .
Death Andronikos seems then to have resolved to exterminate the aristocracy , and his plans were nearly successful .
But on September 11 , 1185 , during his absence from the capital , Stephen Hagiochristophorites moved to arrest Isaac Angelos , whose loyalty was suspect .
Isaac killed Hagiochristophorites and took refuge in the church of Hagia Sophia .
He appealed to the populace , and a tumult arose which spread rapidly over the whole city .
When Andronikos arrived he found that his authority was overthrown : Isaac had been proclaimed Emperor .
He died on September 12 , 1185 .
At the news of the emperor 's death , his son and co-emperor John was murdered by his own troops in Thrace .
Andronikos I was the last of the Komnenoi to rule Constantinople , although his grandsons Alexios and David founded the Empire of Trebizond in 1204 .
Their branch of the dynasty was known as the " Great Komnenoi " ( Megaskomnenoi ) .
Family Andronikos I Komnenos was married twice and had numerous mistresses .
He is mentioned in the Louis L'Amour medieval historical novel , The Walking Drum .
He is among the main characters of the historical novel Agnes of France ( 1980 ) by Greek writer Kostas Kyriazis ( b. 1920 ) .
The novel ends with the death of Andronikos .
Andronikos was portrayed in the novel Baudolino by Umberto Eco , with much detail being given to his grisly end .
Andronicus of Cyrrhus ( Greek : Ανδρόνικος Κυρρήστου ) or Andronicus Cyrrhestes , son of Hermias , was a Greek astronomer who flourished about 100 BC .
He built a horologion at Athens , the so-called Tower of the Winds , a considerable portion of which still exists .
It is octagonal , with figures carved on each side , representing the eight principal winds .
From this model is derived the custom of placing weathercocks on steeples .
Andronicus of Rhodes ( fl .
c. 60 BC ) was a Greek philosopher from Rhodes who was also the head ( scholarch ) of the Peripatetic school .
He is most famous for publishing a new edition of the works of Aristotle which forms the basis of the texts which survive today .
Life Little is known about his life .
He was at the eleventh scholarch of the Peripatetic school .
He taught in Rome , about 58 BC , and was the teacher of Boethus of Sidon , with whom Strabo studied .
Tyrannion commenced this task , but apparently did not do much towards it .
None of these works is extant .

Andronicus or Andronikos is a classical Greek name ( Ανδρόνικος ) , from the Gr .
words " andras " , ( Gr .
άνδρας ) , i.e. man and " Nike " ( Gr .
Νίκη ) , i.e. victory .
The name has the sense of " victorious , warrior " .
The female is Andronike .
Andronicus or Andronikos may refer to : In fiction :
Ammianus Marcellinus ( 325/330 – after 391 ) was a fourth-century Roman historian .
He wrote the penultimate major historical account surviving from Antiquity ( the last was written by Procopius ) .
His work chronicled in Latin the history of Rome from 96 to 378 , although only the sections covering the period 353 – 378 are extant .
Biography Ammianus was born between 325 and 330 in the Greek - speaking East , possibly at Antioch on the Orontes .
The surviving books of his history , the Res Gestae , cover the years 353 to 378 .
Ammianus served as a soldier in the army of Constantius II ( and possibly Julian ) in Gaul and Persia .
With Ursicinus he went twice to the East .
He accompanied this emperor , for whom he expresses enthusiastic admiration , in his campaigns against the Alamanni and the Sassanids .
After the death of Julian , he took part in the retreat of Jovian as far as Antioch .
He was residing in Antioch in 372 when one Theodorus was thought to have been identified by divination as a new Emperor , the successor to Valens .
Marcellinus documented that Theodorus was , with many others , implicated by the use of torture , and cruelly punished .
Though pagan , Marcellinus was mostly tolerant of Christians .
The surviving eighteen books cover the period from 353 to 378 .
As a whole it has been considered extremely valuable , being a clear , comprehensive and in general impartial account of events by a contemporary .
Austrian historian Ernst Stein praised Ammianus as " the greatest literary genius that the world produced between Tacitus and Dante " .
According to Kimberly Kagan , his accounts of battles emphasize the experience of the soldiers but at the cost of ignoring the bigger picture .
As a result it is difficult for the reader to understand why the battles he describes had the outcome they did .
Ammianus ' work contains a detailed description of the tsunami in Alexandria which devastated the metropolis and the shores of the eastern Mediterranean on 21 July 365 .
His report describes accurately the characteristic sequence of earthquake , retreat of the sea and sudden giant wave .
His work has suffered terribly from the manuscript transmission .
Aside from the loss of the first thirteen books , the remaining eighteen are in many places corrupt and lacunose .
The sole surviving manuscript from which almost every other is derived is a ninth-century Carolingian text , V , produced in Fulda from an insular exemplar .
Apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the American Apollo space program and the third intended to land on the Moon .
The flight was commanded by James A. Lovell with John L. " Jack " Swigert as Command Module pilot and Fred W. Haise as Lunar Module pilot .
Swigert was a late replacement for the original CM pilot Ken Mattingly , who was grounded by the flight surgeon after exposure to German measles .
He assigned them to the backup crew simply because of a lack of flight-qualified manpower in the Astronaut Office at the time the assignment needed to be made .
Slayton felt Cooper had a very small chance of receiving the Apollo 13 command if he did an outstanding job with the assignment , which he did not .
Seven days before launch , Charles Duke contracted German measles from one of his children .
This exposed both prime and backup crews , who trained together .
Mattingly was found to be the only one of the other five who had not had German measles as a child and thus was not immune .
Three days before launch , at the insistence of the Flight Surgeon , Swigert was moved to the prime crew .
It is a widespread , hilly selenological area thought to be composed of ejecta from the impact that formed Mare Imbrium .
The next Apollo mission , Apollo 14 , eventually made a successful flight to Fra Mauro .
Crew was on board the USS Iwo Jima 45 minutes later .
Launch and translunar injection The mission was launched at the planned time , 02:13:00 PM EST ( 19:13:00 UTC ) on April 11 .
An anomaly occurred when the second-stage , center ( inboard ) engine shut down about two minutes early .
The vehicle 's guidance system shut the engine down in response to sensed thrust chamber pressure fluctuations .
Later missions implemented anti-pogo modifications that had been under development .
They then settled in for the three-day trip to Fra Mauro .
The crew initially thought that a meteoroid might have struck the Lunar Module ( LM ) .
In fact , the number-2 oxygen tank , one of two in the Service Module ( SM ) , had exploded .
Damaged Teflon insulation on the wires to the stirring fan inside oxygen tank 2 allowed the wires to short-circuit and ignite this insulation .
It is also possible some combustion occurred of the Mylar / Kapton thermal insulation material used to line the oxygen shelf compartment in this bay .
Communications and telemetry to Earth were lost for 1.8 seconds , until the system automatically corrected by switching the antenna from narrow-band to wide-band mode .
The crew was forced to shut down the CM completely and to use the LM as a " lifeboat " .
This situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation , but had not been considered a likely scenario .
Without the LM , the accident would certainly have been fatal .
Crew survival and return journey The damage to the Service Module made safe return from a lunar landing impossible , so Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz aborted the mission .
p. III-14For these reasons , Kranz chose the circumlunar option , using the Moon 's gravity to return the ship to Earth .
However , Apollo 13 had left its initial free-return trajectory earlier in the mission , as required for the planned lunar landing at Fra Mauro .
Therefore , the first order of business was to re-establish the free-return trajectory with a 30.7-sec .
burn of the LM Descent Propulsion System .
burn was so accurate that only two more small course corrections were subsequently needed .
Considerable ingenuity under extreme pressure was required from the crew , flight controller s , and support personnel for the safe return .
The developing drama was shown on television .
Because electrical power was severely limited , no more live TV broadcasts were made ; TV commentators used models and animated footage as illustrations .
Low power levels made even voice communications difficult .
The lunar module consumables were intended to sustain two people for a day and a half , not three people for four days .
Oxygen was the least critical consumable because the LM carried enough to repressurize the LM after each surface EVA .
To keep the LM life-support and communication systems operational until re-entry , the LM was powered down to the lowest levels possible .
III‑17 ,33,40 Availability of lithium hydroxide ( LiOH ) for removing carbon dioxide presented a serious problem .
The CM had an adequate supply of canisters , but these were incompatible with the LM .
Engineers on the ground improvised a way to join the cube-shaped CM canisters to the LM 's cylindrical canister-sockets by drawing air through them with a suit return hose .
The astronauts called the jury-rigged device " the mailbox " .
The un-powered CM got so cold that water began to condense on solid surfaces , causing concern that this might short out electrical systems when it was reactivated .
This turned out not to be a problem , partly because of the extensive electrical insulation improvements instituted after the Apollo 1 fire .
Re-entry and splashdown As Apollo 13 neared Earth , the crew first jettisoned the Service Module so pictures could be taken for later analysis .
It was then that the crew were surprised to see for the first time that the Sector-4 panel had been blown off .
According to the analysts , these pictures also showed the antenna damage and possibly an upward tilt to the fuel cell shelf above the oxygen tank compartment .
Finally , the crew jettisoned the Lunar Module Aquarius , leaving the Command Module Odyssey to begin its lone re-entry through the atmosphere .
The re-entry on a lunar mission normally was accompanied by about four minutes of typical communications blackout caused by ionization of the air around the Command Module .
The blackout in Apollo 13 's reentry lasted six minutes , which was 87 seconds longer than had been expected .
The possibility of heat-shield damage from the tank rupture heightened the tension of the blackout period .
The crew was in good condition except for Haise , who was suffering from a serious urinary tract infection because of insufficient water intake .
To avoid altering the trajectory of the spacecraft , the crew had been instructed to temporarily stop urine dumps .
A misunderstanding prompted the crew to store all urine for the rest of the flight .
The Service Module oxygen tanks were so well insulated that they could safely contain supercritical hydrogen and oxygen for years .
Each oxygen tank held several hundred pounds of oxygen , which was used for breathable air and the production of electricity and water .
The construction of the tanks made internal inspection impossible .
The tank contained several components relevant to the accident : The heater and protection thermostats were originally designed for the command module 's 28-volt DC bus .
The specifications for the heater and thermostat were later changed to allow a 65-volt ground supply , in order to pressurize the tanks more rapidly .
Beechcraft , the tank subcontractor , did not upgrade the thermostat to handle the higher voltage .
The temperature sensor could not read above the highest operational temperature of the heater , which was approximately .
This was not normally a problem because the thermostat was designed to open at .
The oxygen shelf carrying the oxygen tanks was originally installed in the Apollo 10 service module , but was removed to fix a potential electromagnetic interference problem .
During removal , the shelf was accidentally dropped about because a retaining bolt had not been removed .
The report of the Apollo 13 review board considers the probability of tank damage during this incident to be " rather low " .
After the tank was filled for ground testing , it could not be emptied through the normal drain line .
To avoid delaying the mission by replacing the tank , the heater was connected to 65-volt ground power to boil off the oxygen .
Lovell signed off on this procedure .
It should have taken a few days at the thermostatic opening temperature of .
However , when the thermostat opened , the 65-volt supply fused its contacts closed and the heater remained powered .
This raised the temperature of the heater to an estimated .
Because the temperature sensor could not read higher than , the monitoring equipment did not register the true temperature inside the tank .
The gas evaporated in hours rather than days .
The sustained high temperatures melted the Teflon insulation on the fan power supply wires and left them exposed .
When the tank was refilled with oxygen , it became a bomb waiting to go off .
During the " cryo stir " procedure , fan power passed through the bare wires which apparently shorted , producing sparks and igniting the Teflon .
This in turn boiled liquid oxygen faster than the tank vent could remove it .
The other oxygen tank or its piping , located near the failed tank , was damaged , allowing it to leak also .
Design fixes included moving the tanks farther apart , and removing the stirring fans .
This required adding a third tank , so that no tank would go below half full .
An emergency battery was also added to another sector in the service module .
In June 1970 , the Cortright Report provided an in-depth analysis of the mission in an extremely detailed five-chapter report with eight appendices .
Oxygen tank 2 was not the only pressure vessel that failed during this mission .
Prior to the accident , the crew had moved the scheduled entry into the Lunar Module forward by three hours .
After the abort decision , the helium pressure continued to rise and Mission Control predicted the time that the burst disc would rupture .
The helium tank burst disc ruptured at 108:54 , after the lunar flyby .
The expulsion reversed the direction of the passive thermal control ( PTC ) roll ( nicknamed the " barbecue roll " ) .
This came about because Mission Control personnel watching the video feeds of Apollos 11 and 12 had trouble distinguishing the astronauts while both had their helmet sunshades down .
The Apollo 13 mission was called " a successful failure " by Lovell , because of the successful safe return of the astronauts , but the failed lunar landing .
President Nixon awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to the crew and the Apollo 13 Mission Operations Team for their actions during the mission .
The Cold Cathode Gauge Experiment ( CCGE ) which was part of the ALSEP on Apollo 13 was never flown again .
It was a version of the Cold Cathode Ion Gauge ( CCIG ) which featured on Apollo 12 , Apollo 14 , and Apollo 15 .
The CCGE was designed as a standalone version of the CCIG .
On other missions , the CCIG was connected as part of the Suprathermal Ion Detector ( SIDE ) .
Because of the aborted landing , this experiment was never actually deployed .
Plaque and insignia The original lunar plaque on Aquarius bore Mattingly ’s name , so the crew was given a replacement with Swigert ’s name on it .
Aquarius never landed on the Moon , however , so Lovell kept the plaque .
The Apollo 13 crew patch featured three flying horses as Apollo 's ' chariot ' across space .
The mission number appeared in Roman numerals as Apollo XIII .
It is one of two Apollo insignia — the other being Apollo 11 — not to include the names of the crew .
( This was fortunate , considering that original crew member Ken Mattingly was replaced two days before the mission began . )
It was designed by artist Lumen Winter , who based it on a mural he had done for the St. Regis Hotel in New York .
The figure was based on an estimated at $ 1.00 per mile , plus $ 4.00 for the first mile .
An extra $ 536.05 was included for battery charging , oxygen , and an " additional guest in room " ( Swigert ) .
Spacecraft location The command module shell was formerly at the Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace , in Paris .
The command module and the internal components were reassembled , and Odyssey is currently on display at the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center , Hutchinson , Kansas .
Intended to power the mission 's ALSEP , the RTG survived re-entry ( as designed ) and landed in the Tonga Trench .
While it will remain radioactive for several thousand years , it does not appear to be releasing any of its 3.9 kg of radioactive plutonium-238 .
Lovell 's lunar space suit helmet is located at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago , Illinois .

Apollo 13 , a film based on Lost Moon , Jim Lovell 's and Jeffrey Kluger 's book about the event , was released in 1995 .
Technical inaccuracies have also been noted .
The film also depicts Lovell misquoting Swigert 's famous statement , " Houston , we 've had a problem " as " Houston , we have a problem " .
However , the filmmakers purposely changed the line – and the character speaking it – because the original quote made it seem that the problem had already passed .
In 2008 , an interactive theatrical show titled APOLLO 13 : Mission Control premiered at BATS Theatre in Wellington , New Zealand .
The production faithfully recreated the mission control consoles and audience members became part of the storyline .
This ' replacement ' astronaut was a nod to Jack Swigert , who replaced Ken Mattingly shortly before the actual launch in 1970 .
The production toured to other cities extensively in New Zealand and Australia in 2010 – 2011 .
The production travels to the USA in 2012 .
In January 2012 , Heritage stated that the sale had been placed on hold after NASA launched an investigation into whether it was the astronaut ’s property to sell .
The crew was commanded by Walter M. Schirra , with Command Module Pilot Donn F. Eisele , and Lunar Module Pilot R. Walter Cunningham .
The mission was the first manned test of the redesigned Block II Apollo Command/Service Module .
It flew in Earth orbit so the crew could check life-support , propulsion , and control systems .
However , the flight would prove to be the last NASA space flight for all of its three crew members .
It was also the final manned launch from what was then known as Cape Kennedy Air Force Station , Florida .
Crew Backup crew Mission highlights Apollo 7 was a test flight , and confidence-builder .
After the January 1967 Apollo launch pad fire , the Apollo Command Module had been extensively redesigned .
Schirra , who would be the only astronaut to fly Mercury , Gemini and Apollo missions , commanded this Earth-orbital shakedown of the Command and Service Modules .
He had come to be respected and admired by all the astronauts , including Schirra .
But since the Apollo contractor had been changed from McDonnell to North American Rockwell , Wendt had not been pad leader for Apollo 1 .
So Wendt remained as Pad Leader for the entire Apollo program .
Had this been an actual lunar mission , the astronauts would have found the process of LM extraction from the adapter more difficult , risking possible damage .
This reinforced the decision to add a system to completelly separate and jettison the panels on all subsequent Apollo-Saturn V flights .
in reference to The Flintstones cartoon .
Don Eisele called it " a real boot in the rear . "
As sleeping in the fetal position was cramping and painful , an exercise device called the Exer-Genie was provided .
Even though Apollo 's larger cabin was more comfortable than Gemini 's , 11 days in orbit took its toll on the astronauts .
Tension with Schirra began with the launch decision , when flight managers decided to launch with a less than ideal abort option for the early part of the ascent .
Once in orbit , the spacious cabin may have induced some crew motion sickness , which had not been an issue in the earlier , smaller spacecraft .
The crew was unhappy with their food selections , especially the high energy sweets .
They also found the waste collection system cumbersome ( requiring 30 minutes to use ) and smelly .
But the worst problem occurred when Schirra developed a severe head cold .
As a result , he became irritable with requests from Mission Control and all three astronauts began " talking back " to the Capcom .
CAPCOM ( Jack Swigert ) : Roger .
CAPCOM 1 ( Deke Slayton ) : Apollo 7 , this is CAPCOM number 1 .
CAPCOM 1 : All we 've agreed to do on this is flip it .
SCHIRRA : ... with two commanders , Apollo 7 CAPCOM 1 : All we have agreed to on this particular pass is to flip the switch on .
No other activity is associated with TV ; I think we are still obligated to do that .
SCHIRRA : We do not have the equipment out ; we have not had an opportunity to follow setting ; we have not eaten at this point .
At this point , I have a cold .
I refuse to foul up our time lines this way .
This would have been impossible wearing the helmets , as the new Apollo helmets were a continuous " fishbowl " type without a moveable visor , unlike previous helmets .
However , on repeat occasions over the course of the mission , Schirra was instructed that the helmets should be worn for safety reasons .
I think you ought to clearly understand there is absolutely no experience at all with landing without the helmet on .
SCHIRRA : And there no experience with the helmet either on that one .
CAPCOM : That one we 've got a lot of experience with , yes .
SCHIRRA : If we had an open visor , I might go along with that .
I guess you better be prepared to discuss in some detail when we land why we have n't got them on .
I think you 're too late now to do much about it .
SCHIRRA : That 's affirmative .
I do n't think anybody down there has worn the helmets as much as we have .
SCHIRRA : We tried them on this morning .
CAPCOM : Understand that .
The only thing we 're concerned about is the landing .
We could n't care less about the reentry .
But it 's your neck , and I hope you do n't break it .
SCHIRRA : Thanks , babe .
CAPCOM : Over and out .
Exchanges such as this led to Eisele and Cunningham being rejected for future missions ( Schirra had already announced his impending retirement from NASA ) .
Apollo 7 was the only manned Apollo launch to take place from Cape Kennedy Air Force Station 's Launch Complex 34 .
All subsequent Apollo and Skylab missions ( including Apollo-Soyuz ) were launched from Launch Complex 39 at the nearby Kennedy Space Center , and Launch Complex 34 was retired .
As of 2012 , Cunningham is the only surviving member of the crew .
Eisele died in 1987 and Schirra in 2007 .
They had been the only Apollo and Skylab crew not granted this award .
Spacecraft location In January 1969 , the Apollo 7 Command Module was displayed on a NASA float in the inauguration parade of President Richard M. Nixon .
In November 2003 the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. requested them back for display at their new annex at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center .
Currently , the Apollo 7 CM is on loan to the Frontiers of Flight Museum located next to Love Field in Dallas , Texas .
The Roman numeral VII appears in the South Pacific Ocean and the crew 's names appear on a wide black arc at the bottom .
The patch was designed by Allen Stevens of Rockwell International .
Depiction in entertainment Portions of the Apollo 7 mission are dramatized in the miniseries From the Earth to the Moon episode entitled " We Have Cleared the Tower " .
A lost documentary , Log of Apollo 7 , has recently been restored from 16mm film and posted on YouTube .

The mission was the second manned launch of a Saturn V rocket .
After launching on March 3 , 1969 , the crewmen spent ten days in low Earth orbit .
The mission proved the LM worthy of manned spaceflight .
Further tests on the Apollo 10 mission would prepare the LM for its ultimate goal , landing on the Moon .
Crew Backup crew 1 : Originally Clifton Williams was the lunar module pilot for the backup crew .
He died on October 5 , 1967 , in a T-38 crash .
His spot was given to Alan Bean .
Later , when the backup crew flew Apollo 12 , a fourth star was added to their mission patch in remembrance of him .
This was to be followed by a second similar flight , AS-205 , to be crewed by Wally Schirra , Walter Cunningham , and Donn Eisele .
However , delays in the CSM development pushed AS-204 into 1967 .
They immediately began training for this flight , designated AS-205 / 208 , expected to occur in late 1967 .
NASA was able to use the 18-month hiatus to catch up with development and unmanned testing of the LM and the Saturn V Moon launch vehicle .
It was also the first space docking of two vehicles with an internal crew transfer between them .
Apollo 9 gave proof that the Apollo spacecraft were up to this critical task , on which the lives of lunar landing crews would depend .
For this and all subsequent Apollo flights , the crews were allowed to name their own spacecraft ( the last spacecraft to have been named was Gemini 3 ) .
These names were required as radio call signs when the vehicles flew independently .
McDivitt and Schweickart later test-flew the LM , and practiced separation and docking maneuvers in Earth orbit .
This test flight represented the first flight of a manned spacecraft that was not equipped to reenter the Earth 's atmosphere .
Apollo 9 was the last spacecraft to splash down in the Atlantic Ocean .
The command module was displayed at the Michigan Space and Science Center , Jackson , Michigan until April 2004 when the center closed .
In May 2004 , it was moved to the San Diego Aerospace Museum ( now named the San Diego Air and Space Museum ) .
The LM ascent stage orbit decayed on October 23 , 1981 , the LM descent stage ( 1969-018D ) orbit decayed March 22 , 1969 .
The S-IVB stage J-2 engine was restarted after Lunar Module extraction and propelled the stage into solar orbit by burning to depletion .
The crew sang the song " Happy Birthday to You " on March 8 , 1969 .
Mission insignia and spacecraft names The circular patch shows a drawing of a Saturn V rocket with the letters USA on it .
The CSM is trailing rocket fire in a circle .
The crew 's names are along the top edge of the circle , with APOLLO IX at the bottom .
The " D " in McDivitt 's name is filled with red to mark that this was the " D mission " in the alphabetic sequence of Apollo missions .
For the first time since the first manned Gemini mission , the astronauts were allowed to name their spacecraft .
This came about to avoid confusion when dealing with two separate craft flying at the same time .
The crew dubbed the lunar module Spider for its buglike appearance , and the command module Gumdrop because of its shape .

Its service module was jettisoned shortly after the deorbit burn and decayed during reentry of the command module .
The ascent stage of LM-3 Spider ( 1969-018C ) decayed on October 23 , 1981 .
The descent stage of LM-3 Spider ( 1969-018D ) decayed March 22 , 1969 .
The upper stage of the Apollo 9 Saturn V , S-IVB-504N , ( 1969-018B ) is in heliocentric ( solar ) orbit .
There are over 100 different forms of arthritis .
The most common form , osteoarthritis ( degenerative joint disease ) , is a result of trauma to the joint , infection of the joint , or age .
Other arthritis forms are rheumatoid arthritis , psoriatic arthritis , and related autoimmune diseases .
Septic arthritis is caused by joint infection .
The major complaint by individuals who have arthritis is joint pain .
Pain is often a constant and may be localized to the joint affected .
Classification There are several diseases where joint pain is primary , and is considered the main feature .
Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid can also affect other organs in the body with a variety of symptoms .
It is common in advanced arthritis for significant secondary changes to occur .
For example , in someone who has limited their physical activity : These changes can also impact on life and social roles , such as community involvement .
Disability Arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the USA .
More than 20 million individuals with arthritis have severe limitations in function on a daily basis .
Absenteeism and frequent visits to the physician are common in individuals who have arthritis .
Arthritis makes it very difficult for individuals to be physically active and many become home bound .
It is estimated that the total cost of arthritis cases is close to $ 100 billion of which nearly 50 % is from lost earnings .
Each year , arthritis results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to health care centers .
Arthritis can make it very difficult for an individual to remain physically active , contributing to an increased risk of obesity , high cholesterol or vulnerability to heart disease .
Individuals with arthritis are also at increased risk of depression , which may be related to fear of worsening symptoms .
All arthritides potentially feature pain .
Pain patterns may differ depending on the arthritides and the location .
Rheumatoid arthritis is generally worse in the morning and associated with stiffness ; in the early stages , patients often have no symptoms after a morning shower .
Osteoarthritis , on the other hand , tends to be worse after exercise .
Elements of the history of the disorder guide diagnosis .
Physical examination may confirm the diagnosis , or may indicate systemic disease .
Radiographs are often used to follow progression or help assess severity .
Osteoarthritis Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis .
It can affect both the larger and the smaller joints of the body , including the hands , feet , back , hip , and knee .
The disease is essentially one acquired from daily wear and tear of the joint ; however , osteoarthritis can also occur as a result of injury .
Osteoarthritis begins in the cartilage and eventually causes the two opposing bones to erode into each other .
Initially , the condition starts with minor pain during activities , but soon the pain can be continuous and even occur while in a state of rest .
The pain can be debilitating and prevent one from doing some activities .
Osteoarthritis typically affects the weight-bearing joints , such as the back , spine , and pelvis .
Unlike rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis is most commonly a disease of the elderly .
More than 30 percent of women have some degree of osteoarthritis by age 65 .
Risk factors for osteoarthritis include prior joint trauma , obesity , and a sedentary lifestyle .
Osteoarthritis , like rheumatoid arthritis , can not be cured , but one can prevent the condition from worsening .
Physical therapy to strengthen muscles and joints is very helpful .
Pain medications are widely required by individuals with osteoarthritis .
For some patients , weight loss can reduce the stress on the joints .
When the disease is far advanced and the pain is continuous , surgery may be an option .
Unlike rheumatoid arthritis , joint replacement does help many individuals with osteoarthritis .
Rheumatoid arthritis Rheumatoid arthritis is a disorder in which the body 's own immune system starts to attack body tissues .
The attack is not only directed at the joint but to many other parts of the body .
In rheumatoid arthritis , most damage occurs to the joint lining and cartilage which eventually results in erosion of two opposing bones .
Rheumatoid arthritis often affects joints in the fingers , wrists , knees and elbows .
The disease is symmetrical ( appears on both sides of the body ) and can lead to severe deformity in a few years if not treated .
Rheumatoid arthritis occurs mostly in people aged 20 and above .
In children , the disorder can present with a skin rash , fever , pain , disability , and limitations in daily activities .
Often , it is not clear why the rheumatoid arthritis occurred .
With earlier diagnosis and aggressive treatment , many individuals can lead a decent quality of life .
The drugs to treat rheumatoid arthritis range from corticosteroid s to monoclonal antibodies given intravenously .
The latest drugs like Remicade can significantly improve quality of life in the short term .
In rare cases , surgery may be required to replace joints but there is no cure for the illness .
Lupus This is a common collagen vascular disorder that can be present with severe arthritis .
Other features of lupus include a skin rash , extreme photosensitivity , hair loss , kidney problems , lung fibrosis and constant joint pain .
Gout Gout is caused by deposition of uric acid crystals in the joint , causing inflammation .
There is also an uncommon form of gouty arthritis caused by the formation of rhomboid crystals of calcium pyrophosphate known as pseudogout .
In the early stages , the gouty arthritis usually occurs in one joint , but with time , it can occur in many joints and be quite crippling .
The joints in gout can often become swollen and lose function .
Gouty arthritis can become particularly painful and potentially debilitating when gout can not successfully be treated .
Other Infectious arthritis is another severe form of arthritis .
It presents with sudden onset of chills , fever and joint pain .
The condition is caused by bacteria elsewhere in the body .
Infectious arthritis must be rapidly diagnosed and treated promptly to prevent irreversible and permanent joint damage .
Psoriasis can develop into psoriatic arthritis .
With psoriatic arthritis , most individuals develop the skin problem first and then the arthritis .
The typical features are of continuous joint pains , stiffness and swelling .
The disease does recur with periods of remission but there is no cure for the disorder .
Treatment There is no cure for either rheumatoid or osteoarthritis .
Treatment options vary depending on the type of arthritis and include physical therapy , lifestyle changes ( including exercise and weight control ) , orthopedic bracing , medications .
Joint replacement surgery may be required in eroding forms of arthritis .
Medications can help reduce inflammation in the joint which decreases pain .
Moreover , by decreasing inflammation , the joint damage may be slowed .
Physical and occupational therapy In general , studies have shown that physical exercise of the affected joint can have noticeable improvement in terms of long-term pain relief .
Furthermore , exercise of the arthritic joint is encouraged to maintain the health of the particular joint and the overall body of the person .
Individuals with arthritis can benefit from both physical and occupational therapy .
In arthritis the joints become stiff and the range of movement can be limited .
Physical therapy has been shown to significantly improve function , decrease pain , and delay need for surgical intervention in advanced cases .
Exercise prescribed by a physical therapist has been shown to be more effective than medications in treating osteoarthritis of the knee .
Exercise often focuses on improving muscle strength , endurance and flexibility .
In some cases , exercises may be designed to train balance .
Occupational therapy can provide assistance with activities as well as equipment .
Medications There are several types of medications that are used for the treatment of arthritis .
Treatment typically begins with medications that have the fewest side effects with further medications being added if insufficiently effective .
Treatment also depends on the type of the arthritis .
For example , the first-line treatment for osteoarthritis is acetaminophen ( paracetamol ) while for inflammatory arthritis it involves non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen .
Research Recent studies have suggested the use of cannabis for the treatment of arthritis , due to its anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties .
Cannabis is probably less harmful than other available painkillers . "
Epidemiology Arthritis is predominantly a disease of the elderly , but children can also be affected by the disease .
More than 70 % of individuals in North America affected by arthritis are over the age of 65 .
Arthritis is more common in women than men at all ages and affects all races , ethnic group s and cultures .
With an aging population this number is expected to increase .
In early reports , arthritis was frequently referred to as the most common ailment of prehistoric peoples .
It was noted in skeletal remains of Native Americans found in Tennessee and parts of what is now Olathe , Kansas .
Blood test s and X-ray s of the affected joints often are performed to make the diagnosis .
Screening blood tests are indicated if certain arthritides are suspected .
These might include : rheumatoid factor , antinuclear factor ( ANF ) , extractable nuclear antigen , and specific antibodies .
Acetylene ( systematic name : ethyne ) is the chemical compound with the formula C2H2 .
It is a hydrocarbon and the simplest alkyne .
This colorless gas is widely used as a fuel and a chemical building block .
It is unstable in pure form and thus is usually handled as a solution .
Pure acetylene is odorless , but commercial grades usually have a marked odor due to impurities .
As an alkyne , acetylene is unsaturated because its two carbon atoms are bonded together in a triple bond .
The carbon-carbon triple bond places all four atoms in the same straight line , with CCH bond angles of 180 ° .
Since acetylene is a linear symmetrical molecule , it possesses the D ∞ h point group .
Discovery Acetylene was discovered in 1836 by Edmund Davy who identified it as a " new carburet of hydrogen " .
It was rediscovered in 1860 by French chemist Marcellin Berthelot , who coined the name " acetylene " .
Berthelot was able to prepare this gas by passing vapours of organic compounds ( methanol , ethanol , etc. ) through a red-hot tube and collecting the effluent .
He also found acetylene was formed by sparking electricity through mixed cyanogen and hydrogen gases .
Berthelot later obtained acetylene directly by passing hydrogen between the poles of a carbon arc .
In the US , this process was an important part of the late-19th century revolution in chemistry enabled by the massive hydroelectric power project at Niagara Falls .
Bonding In terms of valence bond theory , in each carbon atom the 2s orbital hybridizes with one 2p orbital thus forming an sp hybrid .
The other two 2p orbitals remain unhybridized .
The two unchanged 2p orbitals form a pair of weaker π valence bonds .
Physical properties : changes of state At atmospheric pressure , acetylene can not exist as a liquid and does not have a melting point .
At temperatures below the triple point , solid acetylene can change directly to the vapor ( gas ) by sublimation .
An important reaction of acetylene is its combustion , the basis of the acetylene welding technologies .
Otherwise , its major applications involve its conversion to acrylic acid derivatives .
Compared to most hydrocarbon s , acetylene is relatively acidic , though it is still much less acidic than water or ethanol .
Thus it reacts with strong bases to form acetylide salts .
For example , acetylene reacts with sodium amide in liquid ammonia to form sodium acetylide , and with butyllithium in cold THF to give lithium acetylide .
Acetylide s of heavy metals are easily formed by reaction of acetylene with the metal ions .
Several , e.g. , silver acetylide ( Ag2C2 ) and copper acetylide ( Cu2C2 ) , are powerful and very dangerous explosives .
Reppe chemistry Walter Reppe discovered that in the presence of metal catalyst s , acetylene can react to give a wide range of industrially significant chemicals .
Acetylene usage for welding has dropped significantly .
Bell Canada cable repair technicians still use portable acetylene fueled torch kits as a soldering tool for sealing lead sleeve splices in manhole s and in some aerial locations .
Oxyacetylene welding may also be used in areas where electricity is not readily accessible .
As well , oxy-fuel cutting is still very popular and oxy-acetylene cutting is utilized in nearly every metal fabrication shop .
For use in welding and cutting , the working pressures must be controlled by a regulator , since above 15 psi acetylene will oligomerize explosively .
Niche applications In 1881 , the Russian chemist Mikhail Kucherov described the hydration of acetylene to acetaldehyde using catalysts such as mercury ( II ) bromide .
Before the advent of the Wacker process , this reaction was conducted on an industrial scale .
The polymerization of acetylene with Ziegler-Natta catalyst s produces polyacetylene films .
In the early 20th Century acetylene was widely used for illumination , including street lighting in some towns .
Most early automobiles used carbide lamp s before the adoption of electric headlights .
Acetylene is sometimes used for carburization ( that is , hardening ) of steel when the object is too large to fit into a furnace .
Acetylene is used to volatilize carbon in radiocarbon dating .
The carbonaceous material in an archeological sample is treated with lithium metal in a small specialized research furnace to form lithium carbide ( also known as lithium acetylide ) .
Natural acetylene is believed to form from either catalytic decomposition of long chain hydrocarbons at temperatures of 1,770 K and above .
Safety and handling Acetylene is not especially toxic but when generated from calcium carbide it can contain toxic impurities such as traces of phosphine and arsine .
It is also highly flammable ( hence its use in welding ) .
Its singular hazard is associated with its intrinsic instability , especially when it is pressurized .
Samples of concentrated or pure acetylene can easily react in an addition-type reaction to form a number of products , typically benzene and/or vinylacetylene .
These reactions are exothermic , and unlike other common flammables , do not require oxygen to proceed .
Consequently , acetylene can explode with extreme violence if the absolute pressure of the gas exceeds about 200 kPa ( 29 psi ) .
Most regulators and pressure gauges on equipment report gauge pressure and the safe limit for acetylene therefore is 101 kPagage or 15 psig .
Portable lighting Calcium carbide was used to generate acetylene used in the head lamps for miners and cavers .

Athenian democracy developed in the Greek city-state of Athens , comprising the central city-state of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica , around 550 BC .
Athens is one of the first known democracies .
Participation was by no means open , but the in-group of participants was constituted with no reference to economic class and they participated on a large scale .
The public opinion of voters was remarkably influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theatres .
Solon ( 594 BC ) , Cleisthenes ( 508/7 BC ) , and Ephialtes ( 462 BC ) contributed to the development of Athenian democracy creating new institutions .
It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides ; the most detailed accounts are of this fourth-century modification rather than the Periclean system .
It was suppressed by the Macedon ians in 322 BC .
The Athenian institutions were later revived , but the extent to which they were a real democracy is debatable .
One could assume the new term was coined and adopted by Athenian democrats .
The word is attested in Herodotus , who wrote some of the first surviving Greek prose , but this may not have been before 440 or 430 BC .
Participation and exclusion Size and make-up of the Athenian population Estimates of the population of ancient Athens vary .
During the 4th century BC , there may well have been some 250,000 – 300,000 people in Attica .
Citizen families may have amounted to 100,000 people and out of these some 30,000 will have been the adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly .
In the mid-5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as 60,000 , but this number fell precipitously during the Peloponnesian War .
This slump was permanent due to the introduction of a stricter definition of citizen described below .
The non-citizen component of the population was divided between resident foreigners ( metic s ) and slaves , with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous .
Citizenship in Athens Only adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as ephebe s had the right to vote in Athens .
The percentage of the population that actually participated in the government was about 20 % .
They had restricted movement in public and were very segregated from the men .
Still , in contrast with oligarchical societies , there were no real property qualification for voting .
( The property classes of Solon 's constitution remained on the books , but they fell into disuse . )
This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state .
In the course of a century , the numbers involved were in the hundreds rather than thousands .
Main bodies of governance There were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands .
But crucially citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution as were council members and all other officeholders .
By the mid-4th century however the assembly 's judicial functions were largely curtailed , though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial .
Assembly The central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the assembly ( , ekklêsia ) .
Unlike a parliament , the assembly 's members were not elected , but attended by right when they chose .
The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lot .
As the system evolved these last two functions were shifted to the law courts .
Voting was by simple majority .
In the 5th century at least there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly .
If the assembly broke the law , the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had made the proposal that it had agreed to .
If a mistake had been made , from the assembly 's viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled .
As usual in ancient democracies , one had to physically attend a gathering in order to vote .
Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship .
Voting was usually by show of hands ( χειροτονία , kheirotonia , " arm stretching " ) with officials judging the outcome by sight .
With thousands of people attending , counting was impossible .
At the end of the session , each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots .
Ostracism required the voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery ( ὄστρακα , ostraka ) , though this did not occur within the assembly as such .
In the following century the meetings were set to forty a year , with four in each state month .
One of these was now called the main meeting , kyria ekklesia .
Additional meetings might still be called , especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly rather than in court .
The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals , as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar .
There was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state month .
Attendance at the assembly was not always voluntary .
After the restoration of the democracy in 403 BC , pay for assembly attendance was introduced .
This promoted a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings .
Only the first 6000 to arrive were admitted and paid , with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay .
The boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly , and oversaw the activities of certain other magistrates .
Courts Athens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights ( see atimia ) .
Jurors were required to be under oath , which was not required for attendance at the assembly .
The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly : both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people .
For private suits the minimum jury size was 200 ( increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue ) , for public suits 501 .
For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500 .
The cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by water clock , first prosecutor then defendant .
Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation .
Jurors did talk informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy , shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants .
This may have had some role in building a consensus .
The jury could only cast a ' yes ' or ' no ' vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant .
Justice was rapid : a case could last not longer than one day .
No appeal was possible .
There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor , which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict .
Payment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to Pericles , a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy ( Politics 1294a37 ) .
Pay was raised from 2 to 3 obol s by Cleon early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed ; the original amount is not known .
Notably , this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings .
The system showed a marked anti-professionalism .
No judges presided over the courts nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors ; magistrates had only an administrative function and were laymen .
Most of the annual magistracies at Athens could only be held once in a lifetime .
There were no lawyers as such ; litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens .
Shifting balance between assembly and courts As the system evolved , the courts ( that is , citizens under another guise ) intruded upon the power of the assembly .
From 355 BC political trials were no longer held in the assembly , but only in a court .
In 416 BC the graphē paranómōn ( " indictment against measures contrary to the laws " ) was introduced .
Once again it is important to bear in mind the lack of ' neutral ' state intervention .
The quantity of these suits was enormous : in effect the courts became a kind of upper house .
In the 5th century there was in effect no procedural difference between an executive decree and a law : they were both simply passed by the assembly .
But from 403 BC they were set sharply apart .
Henceforth laws were made not in the assembly , but by special panels of 1000 citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6000 .
They were known as the nomothetai ( νομοθέται ) , the lawmakers .
Nomothetai are junior archons , not the jury .
The degree of participation among citizens varied greatly , along a spectrum from doing virtually nothing towards something like a full-time committent .
Officeholders The administration was in the hands of officeholders , for over a thousand years .
Something like 1100 citizens ( including the members of the council of 500 ) held office each year .
They were mostly chosen by lot , with a much smaller ( and more prestigious ) group of about 100 elected .
Neither was compulsory ; individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods .
In particular , those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise .
This was almost inevitable since , with the notable exception of the generals ( strategoi ) , each office could be held by the same person only once .
Part of the ethos of democracy , however , was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement .
All of them were subject to a review beforehand that might disqualify them for office and an examination after stepping down .
Officeholders were the agents of the people , not their representatives .
Citizens active as office holders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors .
However , when an Athenian took up an office , he was regarded as ' serving ' the people .
As such , he could be regarded as failing in his duty and be punished for it .
There were in fact some limitations on who could hold office .
An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement ( atimia ) , excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily ( depending on the type ) .
Furthermore , all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office ( dokimasia ) at which they might be disqualified .
After leaving office they were subject to a scrutiny ( euthunai , literally ' straightenings ' ) to review their performance .
In the case of a scrutiny going to trial , there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties .
Finally , even during his period of office , any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly .
By and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited .
The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited .
They administered rather than governed .
When it came to penal sanctions , no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas .
Anything higher had to go before a court .
The allotment of an individual was based on citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought .
The random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks , but the system included features meant to obviate possible problems .
Athenians selected for office served as teams ( boards , panels ) .
In a group someone will know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do .
During the period of holding a particular office everyone on the team is observing everybody else .
There were however officials such as the nine archons , who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other .
No office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual .
The only exception was the boule or council of 500 .
In this case , simply by demographic necessity , an individual could serve twice in a lifetime .
This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons .
To the Athenians it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use office as a way of accumulating ongoing power .
ElectionApproximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot .
There were two main categories in this group : those required to handle large sums of money , and the 10 generals , the strategoi .
In the 5th century BC , principally as seen through the figure of Pericles , the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis .
His office holding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded .
Under the 4th century version of democracy the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons .
In part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialised forms of warfare practiced in the later period .
Elected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office .
And they too could be removed from office at any time that the assembly met .
In one case from the 5th century BC , the ten treasurers of the Delian league ( the Hellenotamiai ) were accused at their scrutinies of misappropriation of funds .
( Antiphon 5.69 – 70 ) There was also a death penalty for " inadequate performance " while in office .
Criticism of the democracy Athenian democracy had many critics , both ancient and modern .
For them the demos in democracy meant not the whole people , but the people as opposed to the elite .
Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which ' everyone ' has equal rights , they saw it as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannizing over the rich .
They regarded this as manifestly unjust .
In Aristotle this is categorized as the difference between ' arithmetic ' and ' geometric ' ( i.e. proportional ) equality .
Those writing in later centuries generally had no direct experience of democracy themselves .
To its ancient detractors the democracy was reckless and arbitrary .
They had some signal instances to point to , especially from the long years of the Peloponnesian War .
The focus on number speaks to the drive behind each of them : to reduce the size of the electorate by linking the franchise with property qualifications .
For the first time a conceptual and procedural distinction was made between laws and decrees .
Increasingly , responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts , with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts .
One downside was that the new democracy was less capable of rapid response .
Another tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life .
Although democracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years , they are sometimes associated with each other .
For much of the 5th century at least democracy fed off an empire of subject states .
Thucydides the son of Milesias ( not the historian ) , an aristocrat , stood in opposition to these policies , for which he was ostracised in 443 BC .
Further they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding .
This is the position set out by the anti-democratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the Old Oligarch .
By so strongly validating one role , that of the male citizen , it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it .
Despite this limited franchise , Athenian democracy was certainly the first — and perhaps the best — example of a working direct democracy .
In 88 BC , there was a revolution under the philosopher Athenion , who persuaded the Assembly to agree to elect whomever he might ask to office .
Athenion allied with Mithridates of Pontus , and went to war with Rome ; he was killed during the war , and was replaced by Aristion .
The Indian numerals are traditionally thought to have been adopted by the Persian and Arab mathematicians in India , and passed on to the Arabs further west .
They were transmitted to Europe in the Middle Ages during the period of Arab rule of southern Spain .
The use of Arabic numerals spread around the world through European trade , books and colonialism .
Today they are the most common symbolic representation of numbers in the world .
Europeans did not know about the numerals ' origins in ancient India , so they named them " Arabic numerals " .
Arabs , on the other hand , call the system " Hindu numerals " , referring to their origin in India .
In English , the term Arabic numerals can be ambiguous .
It most commonly refers to the numeral system widely used in Europe and the Americas .
Arabic numerals is the conventional name for the entire family of related systems of Arabic and Indian numerals .
It may also be intended to mean the numerals used by Arabs , in which case it generally refers to the Eastern Arabic numerals .
The decimal Hindu-Arabic numeral system was invented in India around 500 CE .
The system was revolutionary by including a zero and positional notation .
It is considered an important milestone in the development of mathematics .
One may distinguish between this positional system , which is identical throughout the family , and the precise glyph s used to write the numerals , which vary regionally .
The glyphs most commonly used in conjunction with the Latin script since early modern times are 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 .
This helps distinguish it from " Arabic numerals " as the East Arabic numerals specific to the Arabs .
History Origins The digits 1 to 9 in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system evolved from the Brahmi numerals .
Buddhist inscriptions from around 300 BCE use the symbols which became 1 , 4 and 6 .
By the middle of the 2nd millennium BC , the Babylonian mathematics had a sophisticated sexagesimal positional numeral system .
The lack of a positional value ( or zero ) was indicated by a space between sexagesimal numerals .
By 300 BC , a punctuation symbol ( two slanted wedges ) was co-opted as a placeholder in the same Babylonian system .
In a tablet unearthed at Kish ( dating from about 700 BC ) , the scribe Bêl-bân-aplu wrote his zeros with three hooks , rather than two slanted wedges .
The Babylonian placeholder was not a true zero because it was not used alone .
Nor was it used at the end of a number .
Only context could differentiate them .
By this time , the use of the glyph had already reached Persia , and was mentioned in Al-Khwarizmi 's descriptions of Indian numerals .
Numerous Indian documents on copper plates exist , with the same symbol for zero in them , dated back as far as the 6th century CE .
Their work was principally responsible for the diffusion of the Indian system of numeration in the Middle East and the West .
The decimal point notation was introduced by Sind ibn Ali , he also wrote the earliest treatise on Arabic numerals .
Ghubar numerals themselves are probably of Roman origin .
Algoritmi , the translator 's rendition of the author 's name , gave rise to the word algorithm ( Latin algorithmus , " calculation method " ) .
The first mentions of the numerals in the West are found in the Codex Vigilanus of 976 .
From the 980s , Gerbert of Aurillac ( later , Pope Sylvester II ) used his position to spread knowledge of the numerals in Europe .
Gerbert studied in Barcelona in his youth .
He was known to have requested mathematical treatises concerning the astrolabe from Lupitus of Barcelona after he had returned to France .
The numerals are arranged with their lowest value digit to the right , with higher value positions added to the left .
This arrangement was adopted identically into the numerals as used in Europe .
Languages written in the Latin alphabet run from left to right , unlike languages written in the Arabic alphabet .
The European acceptance of the numerals was accelerated by the invention of the printing press , and they became widely known during the 15th century .
( See G.F. Hill , The Development of Arabic Numerals in Europe for more examples . )
By the mid-16th century , they were in common use in most of Europe .
Roman numerals remained in use mostly for the notation of Anno Domini years , and for numbers on clockfaces .
Adoption in Russia Cyrillic numerals were a numbering system derived from the Cyrillic alphabet , used by South and East Slavic peoples .
The system was used in Russia as late as the early 18th century when Peter the Great replaced it with Arabic numerals .
Adoption in China Arabic numerals were introduced to China during the Yuan Dynasty ( 1271 – 1368 ) by the Muslim Hui people .
In the early 17th century , European-style Arabic numerals were introduced by the Jesuits .
Evolution of symbols The numeral system employed , known as algorism , is positional decimal notation .
Various symbol sets are used to represent numbers in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system , all of which evolved from the Brahmi numerals .
ABM or Abm may refer to :
Apuleius ( ; sometimes called Lucius Apuleius ; c. 125 – c. 180 ) was a Latin prose writer .
He was Numidian Berber , from Madaurus ( now M'Daourouch , Algeria ) .
He studied Platonist philosophy in Athens ; travelled to Italy , Asia Minor and Egypt ; and was an initiate in several cults or mysteries .
The most famous incident in his life was when he was accused of using magic to gain the attentions ( and fortune ) of a wealthy widow .
He declaimed and then distributed a witty tour de force in his own defense before the proconsul and a court of magistrates convened in Sabratha , near Tripoli .
This is known as the Apologia .
His most famous work is his bawdy picaresque novel , the Metamorphoses , otherwise known as The Golden Ass .
It is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety .
It relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius , who experiments with magic and is accidentally turned into a donkey .
Details regarding his life come mostly from his defense speech ( Apology ) and his work Florida , which consists of snippets taken from some of his best speeches .
His father was a provincial magistrate ( duumvir ) who bequeathed at his death the sum of nearly two millions of sesterces to his two sons .
Apuleius studied with a master at Carthage ( where he later settled ) and later at Athens , where he studied Platonist philosophy among other subjects .
He also travelled extensively in Asia Minor and Egypt , studying philosophy and religion , burning up his inheritance while doing so .
Apuleius was an initiate in several cults or mysteries , including the Dionysian mysteries .
He was a priest of Aesculapius and , according to Augustine , sacerdos provinciae Africae ( i. e. priest of the province of Carthage ) .
Not long after his return home he set out upon a new journey to Alexandria .
The mother of Pontianus , Pudentilla , was a very rich widow .
With her son 's consent – indeed encouragement – Apuleius agreed to marry her .
The case was heard at Sabratha , near Tripoli , c. 158 CE , before Claudius Maximus , proconsul of Africa .
The accusation itself seems to have been ridiculous , and the spirited and triumphant defence spoken by Apuleius is still extant .
This is known as the Apologia ( A Discourse on Magic ) .
Of his subsequent career we know little .
Judging from the many works of which he was author , he must have devoted himself assiduously to literature .
Works The Golden Ass The Golden Ass ( Asinus Aureus ) or Metamorphoses is the only Latin novel that has survived in its entirety .
In this guise he hears and sees many unusual things , until escaping from his predicament in a rather unexpected way .
Within this frame story are found multiple digressions , the longest among them being the well-known tale of Cupid and Psyche .
He is introduced to the Navigium Isidis .
Other works His other works are : Apuleius wrote many other works which have not survived .
Selkirk judged correctly that his craft , the Cinque Ports , was unseaworthy , and asked to be left there .
By the time he was rescued , he had become adept at hunting and making use of the resources found on the island .
His story aroused great interest at home , and Daniel Defoe 's fictional character Robinson Crusoe was based in part on him .
Early life The son of a shoemaker and tanner in Lower Largo , Fife , Scotland , Alexander Selkirk was born in 1676 .
In his youth he displayed a quarrelsome and unruly disposition .
Summoned in August 1693 before the Kirk Session for his " indecent conduct in church , " he " did not appear , being gone to sea . "
He was back at Largo in 1701 when he again came to the attention of church authorities for beating up his brothers .
Early on he was engaged in buccaneering .
In 1703 he joined an expedition of the English privateer and explorer William Dampier to the South Seas , setting sail from Kinsale in Ireland on 11 September .
While Dampier was captain of the St George , Selkirk served on the Cinque Ports , the St George companion , as sailing master under Thomas Stradling .
By this time Selkirk must have had considerable experience at sea .
The expedition was not very successful .
A raid on the Panamanian gold mining town of Santa María also failed when their landing party was ambush ed .
The easy capture of a heavily-laden Spanish merchantman , the Asunción , revived the men 's hopes of plunder , and Selkirk was put in charge of this prize .
In May 1704 Stradling decided to abandon Dampier and strike out on his own .
Selkirk had grave concerns about the seaworthiness of his vessel .
He would rather be left on Juan Fernández , he declared , than continue in a dangerously leaky ship .
He likely wanted to make the needed repairs before going any further .
Instead , Stradling decided to grant his request , and he was landed with his personal effects on the island .
Selkirk regretted his rashness , but Stradling refused to take him on board again .
The Cinque Ports did indeed later founder off the coast of what is present-day Colombia .
Stradling and some of his crew survived the loss of their ship but were forced to surrender to the Spanish .
The survivors were taken to Lima in Peru where they endured a harsh imprisonment .
Life on the island Selkirk remained at first along the shoreline of Más a Tierra .
During this time he ate shellfish , and scanned the ocean daily for rescue , suffering all the while from loneliness , misery and remorse .
Hordes of raucous sea lions , gathering on the beach for the mating season , eventually drove him to the island 's interior .
Once inland , his way of life took a turn for the better .
Although rats would attack him at night , he was able , by domesticating and living near feral cats , to sleep soundly and in safety .
He proved resourceful in using items brought from the ship as well as materials that he found on the island .
He forged a new knife out of barrel hoops left on the beach .
He built two huts out of pimento tree s , one of which he used for cooking and the other for sleeping .
He employed his musket to hunt goats and his knife to clean their carcasses .
As his gunpowder dwindled , he had to chase prey on foot .
During one such chase he was badly injured when he tumbled from a cliff , lying unconscious for about a day .
His prey had cushioned his fall , likely sparing him a broken back .
The lessons he had learned as a child from his father , a tanner , now served him well .
When his clothes wore out , he made new ones from hair-covered goatskins using a nail for sewing .
As his shoes became unusable , he had no need to replace them , since his toughened , callused feet made protection unnecessary .
He sang psalms and read from the Bible , finding it a comfort in his situation and a prop for his English .
During his sojourn on the island , two vessels came to anchor .
Unfortunately for him , both were Spanish .
As a Scotsman and privateer , he risked a grim fate if captured and , therefore , he tried to hide himself .
Once he was spotted and chased by a group of sailors from one of the ships .
His Spanish pursuers urinated beneath the tree that he was hiding in , but failed to discover him .
Frustrated , his would-be captors gave up and sailed away .
The landing party that met Selkirk was led by Thomas Dover .
After four years and four months without any human company , Selkirk was almost incoherent with joy .
The Duke captain and leader of the expedition , Woodes Rogers , mischievously referred to him as the governor of the island .
The agile castaway , catching two or three goats a day , helped restore the health of Rogers ' men , who were suffering from scurvy .
He made Selkirk the Duke second mate , later giving him command of one of their prize ships , the Increase , before it was ransomed by the Spanish .
Selkirk returned to privateering with a vengeance .
He had been away for eight years .
In 1712 Rogers wrote a book about their privateering odyssey , A Cruising Voyage Round the World , in which he included an account of Selkirk 's ordeal .
The following year , the prominent essay ist Richard Steele wrote an article about him for The Englishman .
Claiming his share of the Duke plunder — about £ 800 ( equivalent to £ today ) — Selkirk appeared set to enjoy a life of ease and celebrity .
Nevertheless , with legal disputes making the amount of any payment uncertain , the sea continued to beckon him .
After a few months in London , he began to seem more like his former self again .
In September 1713 he was charged with assaulting a shipwright in Bristol , and kept in confinement for two years .
He returned to Lower Largo early in 1717 , where he met Sophia Bruce , a sixteen-year-old dairymaid .
They eloped to London but apparently did not marry .
He was soon off to sea again , having enlisted in the Royal Navy .
While on a visit to Plymouth , he married a widowed innkeeper named Frances Candis .
He was buried at sea .
When Daniel Defoe 's The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe was published in 1719 , few readers could have missed the resemblance to Selkirk .
He is dressed in the familiar hirsute goatskins , his feet and shins bare .
This incongruity supports the popular belief that Selkirk was at least a partial model for the fictional character .
Commemoration Selkirk is well-remembered in his former island home .
In 1863 the crew of placed a bronze tablet at a spot called Selkirk 's Lookout on a hill of Más a Tierra in memory of his stay .
On 1 January 1966 Chilean president Eduardo Frei Montalva renamed Más a Tierra Robinson Crusoe Island , after Defoe 's fictional character , in order to attract tourists .
He has also been memorialised in his Scottish birthplace .
David Gillies of Cardy House , Lower Largo , a descendant of the Selkirks , donated the statue created by Thomas Stuart Burnett ARSA .
Archaeological findings An archaeological expedition to the Juan Fernández Islands in February 2005 found part of a nautical instrument that could have belonged to Selkirk .
The archaeologists discovered the artefact while excavating a campsite located not far from Selkirk 's Lookout where the famous castaway may have lived .
Oh , Alexander Selkirk knew the plight Of being king and government and nation .
A road , a mile of kingdom , I am king Of banks and stones and every blooming thing .
These passengers , by reason of their clinging to a mast , Upon a desert island were eventually cast .
They hunted for their meals , as Alexander Selkirk used , But they could n’t chat together — they had not been introduced .
Distributed by Disney , it was the first full-length animated feature to be produced in Uruguay .
An anti-ballistic missile ( ABM ) is a missile designed to counter ballistic missile s ( a missile for missile defense ) .
A ballistic missile is used to deliver nuclear , chemical , biological or conventional warhead s in a ballistic flight trajectory .
The term " anti-ballistic missile " describes any antimissile system designed to counter ballistic missiles .
However the term is used more commonly for systems designed to counter intercontinental ballistic missile s ( ICBMs ) .
Current counter-ICBM systems There are only two systems in the world that can intercept ICBMs .
The Russian A-35 anti-ballistic missile system for defense of Moscow , whose development started in 1971 .
Instead of using an explosive charge , it launches a kinetic projectile .
The George W. Bush administration accelerated development and deployment of a system proposed in 1998 by the Clinton administration .
The system is a dual purpose test and interception facility in Alaska , and in 2006 was operational with a few interceptor missiles .
The Alaska site provides more protection against North Korean missiles or launches from Russia or China , but is likely less effective against missiles launched from the Middle East .
President Bush referenced the 9/11 attacks and the proliferation of ballistic missiles as reasons for missile defense .
The current GMD system has the more limited goal of shielding against a limited attack by a rogue state .
US plans for Central European site During 1993 , a symposium was held by western European nations to discuss potential future ballistic missile defence programs .
In the end , the council recommended deployment of early warning and surveillance systems as well as regionally controlled defence systems .
During Spring 2006 reports about negotiations between the United States and Poland as well as the Czech Republic were published .
The plans propose the installation of a latest generation ABM system with a radar site in the Czech Republic and the launch site in Poland .
The system was announced to be aimed against ICBMs from Iran and North Korea .
This caused harsh comments by then-Russia 's President Vladimir Putin at the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe ( OSCE ) security conference during spring 2007 in Munich .
As of July 2007 , a majority of Poles were opposed to hosting a component of the system in Poland .
They are not capable of intercepting an ICBM , even if it is in range .
United States In several tests , the U.S. military have demonstrated the feasibility of destroying long and short range ballistic missiles .
U.S. Navy Aegis combat system uses RIM-161 Standard missile SM-3 .
A new system , scheduled for deployment during 2009 , is U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) system .
It has a longer range , but it is not known if it will be able to intercept ICBMs .
These systems , as opposed to US GMD system , are not capable of intercepting an ICBM , even if it is in range .
People 's Republic of China Historical Project 640Project 640 had been the PRC 's indigenous effort to develop ABM capability .
The Academy of Anti-Ballistic Missile & Anti-Satellite was established from 1969 for the purpose of developing Project 640 .
The FJ-1 had completed two successful flight tests during 1979 , while the low-altitude interceptor FJ-2 completed some successful flight tests using scaled prototypes .
A high altitude FJ-3 interceptor was also proposed .
Despite the development of missiles , the programme was slowed down due to financial and political reasons .
Operational Chinese systemIn March 2006 , China tested an interceptor system comparable to the U.S. Patriot missiles .
Currently , China has acquired and is license-producing the S-300PMU-2 / S-300PMU-1 series of terminal ABM-capable SAMs .
China-produced HQ-9 SAM system may have some terminal ABM capabilities , but it is inferior to the imported Russian S-300PMU2 Favorit .
PRC Navy 's currently operating modern air-defense destroyers known as the Type 052C Destroyer and Type 051C Destroyer are armed with naval HHQ-9 missiles .
China carried out a land-based anti-ballistic missile test on 11 January 2010 .
The test was exoatmospheric and done in midcourse phase and with a kinetic kill vehicle .
China is the second country after US that demonstrated intercepting ballistic missile with a kinetic kill vehicle , the interceptor missile was a SC-19 .
The sources suggest the system is not operationally deployed as of 2010 .
On January 27 , 2013 , China did another anti ballistic missile test .
According to the Chinese Defence Ministry , the missile launch is defensive in character and is not aimed against any countries .
Experts hailed China 's technological breakthrough because it is difficult to intercept ballistic missiles that have reached the highest point and speed in the middle of their course .
Only 2 countries , including the US , have successfully conducted such a test in the past decade .
Rumored midcourse missiles : France , United Kingdom and Italy Italy and France have developed a missile family called Aster ( Aster 15 and Aster 30 ) .
Aster 30 is capable of ballistic missile defense .
Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer s and French Navy and Italian Navy Horizon - class frigates are armed with PAAMS , using Aster 15 and 30 missiles .
Also France is developing another version , Aster 30 block II which can destroy ballistic missiles with a maximum range of 3000 km .
It will have a Kill Vehicle warhead .
So far tests have been successful , and there are planned 11 locations that the PAC-3 will be installed .
Along with the PAC-3 , Japan has installed a US-developed ship-based anti-ballistic missile system , which was tested successfully on 18 December 2007 .
The missile was launched from a Japanese warship , in partnership with the US Missile Defense Agency and destroyed a mock target launched from the coast .
India India has an active ABM development effort using indigenously developed and integrated radars , and indigenous missiles .
The PAD missile has the secondary stage of the Prithvi missile and can reach altitude of .
During the test the target missile was intercepted at an altitude .
India became the fourth nation in the world to acquire such a capability and the third nation to acquire it using in house research and development .
On 6 December 2007 the Advanced Air Defence ( AAD ) missile system was tested successfully .
This missile is an Endoatmospheric interceptor with an altitude of .
According to scientist V K Saraswat of DRDO , the missiles will work in tandem to ensure a hit probability of 99.8 percent .
Phase IOn 6 March 2009 India successfully tested an interceptor missile that destroyed an incoming missile .
A Dhanush missile was launced from a ship about from the coast .
It rose to a height of and as it began its downward trajectory , the interceptor was launched and successfully achieved a kill .
On 6 March 2011 India successfully tested an indigenously built interceptor missile , bringing down an incoming target ballistic missile from Wheeler Island off the Orissa coast .
The interceptor was fired five minutes after the target was fired .
On 10 February 2012 , India successfully tested its ABM capabilities .
A modified surface-surface missile ' Prithvi ' was used as a hostile missile .
An interceptor Advanced Air Defence ( AAD ) successfully knocked down the hostile missile at an altitude of 15 km .
On 6 May 2012 , Dr. V. K. Saraswat confirmed that Phase-I is complete and can be deployed to protect two Indian cities at a short notice .
He also added that Phase-I is comparable to PAC-3 system .
New Delhi , the national capital , and Mumbai , have been selected for the ballistic missile defence shield .
This shield can destroy incoming ballistic missiles with have range of up to 2,000 km .
On November 23 , 2012 India again tested its experimental ballistic missile defence ( BMD ) system to intercept two " incoming hostile " missiles with interceptor missiles .
We are now ready to convert the BMD system from an experimental to an operational one that can be deployed on demand .
Only one of the incoming missiles was real : a modified Prithvi missile mimicking M-9 / M-11 class of Chinese Dong Feng short-range ballistic missiles .
The other was an electronically simulated missile of a longer range of 1,500 km .
Phase II is expected to be completed by 2016 .
PDVIn 2009 , reports emerged of a new missile named the PDV .
The PDV is said to be a two solid stage hypersonic anti-ballistic missile similar in class to the THAAD .
The PDV is intended to replace the existing PAD in the PAD/AAD combination .
It will have an IIR seeker for its kill vehicle as well .
Whereupon Phase 2 development will take over for protection against missiles of the range class .
The first test flight of the missile is expected in 2010 .
The PDV is designed to take out the target missile at altitudes above .
Three TierThe existing two-tier system is designed to track and destroy ballistic missiles both inside ( endo ) and outside ( exo ) the earth 's atmosphere .
Israel Arrow The Arrow project was begun after the U.S. and Israel agreed to co-fund it on 6 May 1986 .
During 1998 the Israeli military conducted a successful test of their Arrow missile .
On 29 July 2004 Israel and the United States carried out joint experiment in the USA , in which the Arrow was launched against a real Scud missile .
The experiment was a success , as the Arrow destroyed the Scud with a direct hit .
During December 2005 the system was deployed successfully in a test against a replicated Shahab-3 missile .
This feat was repeated on 11 February 2007 .
The system was created as a defensive countermeasure to the rocket threat against Israel 's civilian population on its northern and southern borders .
It is designed to intercept very short-range threats up to 70 kilometers in all-weather situations .
It was declared operational and initially deployed on 27 March 2011 near Beersheba .
On 7 April 2011 , the system successfully intercepted a Grad rocket launched from Gaza for the first time .
During the short Gaza War of November 2012 , Iron Dome interceptors destroyed 84 % of incoming missiles .
Although reports suggest a promising system , the ROC government continues to be interested strongly in the American Terminal High Altitude Area Defense ( THAAD ) program .
The V-2 , the first true ballistic missile , was impossible to destroy using aircraft or artillery .
Instead , the Allies launched Operation Crossbow to find and destroy V-2s before launch .
The American armed forces began experimenting with anti-missile missiles soon after World War II , as the extent of German research into rocketry became clear .
The devices used were the 1.7 kt boosted fission W25 warhead .
The movement of these charged particles in the Earth 's magnetic field causes a powerful EMP which induces very large currents in any conductive material .
The purpose was to determine how much the EMP would interfere with radar tracking and other communications and the level of destruction of electronic circuitry aboard missiles and satellites .
The project 's results are not known , although similar so-called ' effects tests ' were a regular feature of underground tests at the Nevada Test Site until 1992 .
These ' effects tests ' are used to determine how resistant specific warheads , reentry vehicles ( RVs ) and other components are to exoatmospheric nuclear explosions .
Canada Other countries were also involved in early ABM research .
A more advanced project was at CARDE in Canada , which researched the main problems of ABM systems .
After a series of drastic budget reductions during the late 1950s the research ended .
The first operational ABM system – Moscow The first real and successful ABM hit-to-kill test was conducted by the Soviet PVO forces on 1 March 1961 .
The dummy warhead was destroyed by the impact of 16,000 tungsten-carbide spherical impactors 140 seconds after launch , at an altitude of .
The V-1000 missile system was nonetheless considered not reliable enough and abandoned in favor of nuclear-armed ABMs .
The first operational ICBM ABM system was the Soviet A-35 anti-ballistic missile system , designed to protect Moscow .
It was initially a single-layer exoatmospheric ( outside the atmosphere ) design , using A350 ( NATO name : ABM1 Galosh interceptors ) .
It became operational in 1971 and was deployed at four sites around Moscow .
A-35 was upgraded during the 1980s to a two-layer system , the A-135 .
The ABM-3 alone was considered to be technologically equivalent to the United States Safeguard system of 1975 .
American Nike-X of 1960s and plans of Sentinel The Soviet initial experiments were closely followed by United States Nike Zeus , a modification of then-existing anti-aircraft missiles .
Nike Zeus proved unworkable , and so work proceeded with Nike X .
Nike X was a system of two missiles , radars and their associated control systems .
A second shorter-range missile called Sprint with very high acceleration was added to handle warheads that evaded longer-ranged Spartan .
The new Spartan missile changed the deployment plans .
The experimental success of Nike X persuaded the Lyndon B. Johnson administration to propose a thin ABM defense , that could provide almost complete coverage of the United States .
In a September 1967 speech , Defense Secretary Robert McNamara referred to it as Sentinel .
In the meantime a public debate over the merit of ABMs began .
Difficulties that had already made an ABM system questionable for defending against an all-out attack .
One problem was the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System ( FOBS ) that would give little warning to the defense .
Another problem was high altitude EMP ( whether from offensive or defensive nuclear warheads ) which could degrade defensive radar systems .
When this proved infeasible for economic reasons , a much smaller deployment using the same systems was proposed , namely Safeguard ( described later ) .
The problem of defense against MIRVs ABM systems were developed initially to counter single warheads launched from large Intercontinental ballistic missile s ( ICBMs ) .
In an arms race the defense would always win .
Conditions changed dramatically in 1970 with the introduction of Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle ( MIRV ) warheads .
Suddenly each launcher was throwing not one warhead , but several .
In summary , the MIRV made ABM economically ineffective , and practically non-workable .
By the ABM treaty and a 1974 revision , each country was allowed to deploy a mere 100 ABMs to protect a single , small area .
The Soviets retained their Moscow defences .
The U.S. designated their ICBM sites near Grand Forks Air Force Base , North Dakota , where Safeguard was already under advanced development .
The radar systems and anti-ballistic missiles were approximately 90 miles north/northwest of Grand Forks AFB , near Concrete , North Dakota .
The missiles were deactivated in 1975 .
The main radar site ( PARCS ) is still used as an early warning ICBM radar , facing relative north .
It is located at Cavalier Air Force Station , North Dakota .
SDI was an extremely ambitious program to provide a total shield against a massive Soviet ICBM attack .
The initial concept envisioned large sophisticated orbiting laser battle stations , space-based relay mirrors , and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites .
Later research indicated that some planned technologies such as X-ray laser s were not feasible with then-current technology .
As research continued , SDI evolved through various concepts as designers struggled with the difficulty of such a large complex defense system .
SDI remained a research program and was never deployed .
Several post-SDI technologies are used by the present Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) .
Lasers originally developed for the SDI plan are currently in use for astronomical observations .
Used to ionize gas in the upper atmosphere , they provide telescope operators with a target to calibrate their instruments .
Tactical ABMs deployed in 1990s The Israeli Arrow missile system was tested initially during 1990 , before the first Gulf War .
The Arrow was supported by the United States throughout the 1990s .
The Patriot antiaircraft missile was the first deployed tactical ABM system , although it was not designed from the outset for that task and consequently had limitations .
It was used during the 1991 Gulf War to attempt to intercept Iraqi Scud missiles .
Testing ABM technology continued during the 1990s with mixed success .
After the Gulf War , improvements were made to several U.S. air defense systems .
A new Patriot , PAC-3 , was developed and tested — a complete redesign of the PAC-2 deployed during the war , including a totally new missile .
The improved guidance , radar and missile performance improves the probability of kill over the earlier PAC-2 .
During Operation Iraqi Freedom , Patriot PAC-3s had a nearly 100 % success rate against Iraqi TBMs fired .
However since no longer range Iraqi Scud missiles were used , PAC-3 effectiveness against those was untested .
Patriot was involved in three friendly fire incidents : two incidents of Patriot shootings at coalition aircraft and one of U.S. aircraft shooting at a Patriot battery .
MIM-23 Hawk missile is not operational in the U.S. service since 2002 , but is used by many other countries .
Soon after the Gulf war , the Aegis combat system was expanded to include ABM capabilities .
The Standard missile system was also enhanced and tested for ballistic missile interception .
During the late 1990s SM-2 block IVA missiles were tested in a theater ballistic missile defense function .
Standard Missile 3 ( SM-3 ) systems have also been tested for an ABM role .
In 2008 an SM-3 missile launched from a Ticonderoga-class cruiser , the USS Lake Erie , successfully intercepted a non-functioning satellite .
From 1992 to 2000 a demonstration system for the US Army Terminal High Altitude Area Defense was deployed at White Sands Missile Range .
Tests were conducted on a regular basis and resulted in early failures , but successful intercepts occurred during 1999 .
Rather than use sophisticated large laser battle stations and nuclear-pumped X-ray laser satellites , Brilliant Pebbles consisted of a thousand very small , intelligent orbiting satellites with kinetic warheads .
The system relied on improvements of computer technology , avoided problems with overly centralized command and control and risky , expensive development of large , complicated space defense satellites .
It promised to be much less expensive to develop and have less technical development risk .
The name Brilliant Pebbles comes from the small size of the satellite interceptors and great computational power enabling more autonomous targeting .
Development was discontinued later in favor of a limited ground-based defense .
Such system was developed since 1992 , is expected to become operational in 2010 and capable of intercepting small number of incoming ICBMs .
First called the National Missile Defense ( NMD ) , since 2002 it was renamed Ground-Based Midcourse Defense ( GMD ) .
It was planned to protect all 50 states from a rogue missile attack .
The Alaska interceptors may be augmented later by the naval Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System , by ground-based missiles in other locations , or by the Boeing Airborne Laser .
In terms of organization , during 1993 SDI was reorganized as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization ( BMDO ) .
In 2002 it was renamed to Missile Defense Agency ( MDA ) .
The action was covered by the ostensible reason of needing to defend against the possibility of a missile attack conducted by a rogue state .
The next day , Russian Federation promptly dropped the START II agreement , intended to completely ban MIRV s. Footnotes See also External links
The acre is a unit of area used in the imperial and U.S. customary systems .
An acre is about 40 % of a hectare – slightly smaller than an American football field .
It is still used , to some extent , in Canada .
The international symbol of the acre is ac , and is defined as 1/640 of a square mile .
The most commonly used acre today is the international acre .
In the United States both the international acre and the slightly different US survey acre are in use .
The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land .
Description One acre equals 0.0015625 square mile s , 4,840 square yard s , 43,560 square feet or about ( see below ) .
A square enclosing one acre is approximately 69.57 yards , or on a side .
As a unit of measure , an acre has no prescribed shape ; any perimeter enclosing 43,560 square feet is an acre in size .
The acre is often used to express areas of land in the United States , Canada , and in countries where the Imperial System is still in use .
, the acre is not used officially in the United Kingdom but is still often seen on estate agents ' boards .
In the metric system , the hectare is commonly used for the same purpose .
Surveyors in the United States use both international and survey feet , and consequently , both varieties of acre .
Areas are seldom stated to sufficient accuracy for the different definitions to be detectable .
The Quarter Acre Block - Australia and New Zealand In Australia n and New Zealand English , a quarter acre is a term for a suburban plot of land .
South Asia In India , especially in South India , residential plots are measured in cent s or decimel , which is one hundredth of an acre , or .
In Sri Lanka the division of an acre into 160 perches or 4 roods is common .
To be more exact , one acre is 90.75 percent of a long by wide American football field ( without the end zones ) .
The full field , including the end zones , covers approximately .
For residents of other countries , the acre might be envisaged as approximately 56.68 percent of a long by wide association football ( soccer ) pitch .
It may also be remembered as 44,000 square feet , less 1 % .
In English it was historically spelt .
The acre was approximately the amount of land tillable by a yoke of oxen in one day .
This explains one definition as the area of a rectangle with sides of length one chain and one furlong .
A long narrow strip of land is more efficient to plough than a square plot , since the plough does not have to be turned so often .
The word " furlong " itself derives from the fact that it is one furrow long .
Before the enactment of the metric system , many countries in Europe used their own official acres .
For example , a certain landowner might have been said to own 32,000 acres of land , not 50 square miles of land .
The acre is related to the square mile , with 640 acres making up one square mile .
One mile is 5280 feet ( 1760 yards ) .
In western Canada and the western United States , divisions of land area were typically based on the square mile , and fractions thereof .
Most of the Canadian Prairie Provinces and the US midwest is on square mile grids for surveying purposes .

ATP may refer to : Biology Music and theater Sport Technology Transport Other
Adenosine-5 ' - triphosphate ( ATP ) is a nucleoside triphosphate used in cells as a coenzyme .
It is often called the " molecular unit of currency " of intracellular energy transfer .
ATP transports chemical energy within cells for metabolism .
Substrate level phosphorylation , oxidative phosphorylation in cellular respiration , and photophosphorylation in photosynthesis are three major mechanisms of ATP biosynthesis .
Metabolic processes that use ATP as an energy source convert it back into its precursors .
Apart from its roles in energy metabolism and signaling , ATP is also incorporated into nucleic acid s by polymerase s in the processes of DNA replication and transcription .
ATP is the neurotransmitter believed to signal the sense of taste .
The structure of this molecule consists of a purine base ( adenine ) attached to the 1 ' carbon atom of a pentose sugar ( ribose ) .
Three phosphate groups are attached at the 5 ' carbon atom of the pentose sugar .
It is the addition and removal of these phosphate groups that inter-convert ATP , ADP and AMP .
When ATP is used in DNA synthesis , the ribose sugar is first converted to deoxyribose by ribonucleotide reductase .
ATP was discovered in 1929 by Karl Lohmann , Fiske and Y. Subba Rao of Harvard Medical School but its correct structure was not determined until some years later .
It was first artificially synthesized by Alexander Todd in 1948 .
Physical and chemical properties ATP consists of adenosine — composed of an adenine ring and a ribose sugar — and three phosphate groups ( triphosphate ) .
Consequently , it is closely related to the adenosine nucleotide , a monomer of RNA .
ATP is highly soluble in water and is quite stable in solutions between pH 6.8 – 7.4 , but is rapidly hydrolysed at extreme pH. .
Consequently , ATP is best stored as an anhydrous salt .
ATP is an unstable molecule in unbuffered water , in which it hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate .
Thus , if ATP and ADP are in chemical equilibrium in water , almost all of the ATP will eventually be converted to ADP .
A system that is far from equilibrium contains Gibbs free energy , and is capable of doing work .
This displacement from equilibrium means that the hydrolysis of ATP in the cell releases a large amount of free energy .
Two high-energy phosphate bonds ( phosphoanhydride bonds ) ( those that connect adjacent phosphates ) in an ATP molecule are responsible for the high energy content of this molecule .
In the context of biochemical reactions , these anhydride bonds are frequently — and sometimes controversially — referred to as high-energy bonds .
Energy stored in ATP may be released upon hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds .
The primary phosphate group on the ATP molecule that is hydrolyzed when energy is needed to drive anabolic reactions is the γ-phosphate group .
Located the farthest from the ribose sugar , it has a higher energy of hydrolysis than either the α - or β-phosphate .
The bonds formed after hydrolysis — or the phosphorylation of a residue by ATP — are lower in energy than the phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP .
During enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP or phosphorylation by ATP , the available free energy can be harnessed by a living system to do work .
However , a more representative value ( which takes AMP into consideration ) called the Energy charge is increasingly being employed .
Under typical cellular conditions , ΔG is approximately − 57 kJ/mol ( − 14 kcal/mol ) .
As ATP has several negatively charged groups in neutral solution , it can chelate metals with very high affinity .
Due to the strength of these interactions , ATP exists in the cell mostly in a complex with .
Biosynthesis The ATP concentration inside the cell is typically 1 – 10 mM .
ATP can be produced by redox reactions using simple and complex sugars ( carbohydrates ) or lipids as an energy source .
For complex fuels to be synthesized into ATP , they first need to be broken down into smaller , more simple molecules .
Carbohydrates are hydrolysed into simple sugars , such as glucose and fructose .
Fats ( triglyceride s ) are metabolised to give fatty acids and glycerol .
The overall process of oxidizing glucose to carbon dioxide is known as cellular respiration and can produce about 30 molecules of ATP from a single molecule of glucose .
Glycolysis In glycolysis , glucose and glycerol are metabolized to pyruvate via the glycolytic pathway .
Glycolysis generates a net two molecules of ATP through substrate phosphorylation catalyzed by two enzymes : PGK and pyruvate kinase .
Two molecules of NADH are also produced , which can be oxidized via the electron transport chain and result in the generation of additional ATP by ATP synthase .
The pyruvate generated as an end-product of glycolysis is a substrate for the Krebs Cycle .
The oxidation of an NADH molecule results in the synthesis of 2-3 ATP molecules , and the oxidation of one FADH2 yields between 1-2 ATP molecules .
The majority of cellular ATP is generated by this process .
In the absence of oxygen the citric acid cycle will cease to function due to the lack of available NAD + and FAD .
Instead of transferring the generated NADH , a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate , which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix .
Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction , producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion 's interior store of NAD + .
A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space .
This creates a proton motive force that is the net effect of a pH gradient and an electric potential gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane .
Flow of protons down this potential gradient — that is , from the intermembrane space to the matrix — provides the driving force for ATP synthesis by ATP synthase .
This enzyme contains a rotor subunit that physically rotates relative to the static portions of the protein during ATP synthesis .
However , it is also necessary to transport phosphate into the mitochondrion ; the phosphate carrier moves a proton in with each phosphate , partially dissipating the proton gradient .
Beta oxidation Fatty acids can also be broken down to acetyl-CoA by beta-oxidation .
Because NADH and FADH2 are energy-rich molecules , dozens of ATP molecules can be generated by the beta-oxidation of a single long acyl chain .
In most eukaryotes , glucose is used as both an energy store and an electron donor .
The equation for the oxidation of glucose to lactic acid is : Anaerobic respiration Anaerobic respiration is the process of respiration using an electron acceptor other than .
In prokaryotes , multiple electron acceptors can be used in anaerobic respiration .
These include nitrate , sulfate or carbon dioxide .
These processes lead to the ecologically important processes of denitrification , sulfate reduction and acetogenesis , respectively .
Here , light energy is used to pump protons across the chloroplast membrane .
This produces a proton-motive force and this drives the ATP synthase , exactly as in oxidative phosphorylation .
Some of the ATP produced in the chloroplasts is consumed in the Calvin cycle , which produces triose sugars .
ATP recycling The total quantity of ATP in the human body is about 0.2 mole .
The majority of ATP is not usually synthesised de novo , but is generated from ADP by the aforementioned processes .
Thus , at any given time , the total amount of ATP + ADP remains fairly constant .
The energy used by human cells requires the hydrolysis of 100 to 150 moles of ATP daily , which is around 50 to 75 kg .
A human will typically use up his or her body weight of ATP over the course of the day .
This means that each ATP molecule is recycled 500 to 750 times during a single day ( 100 / 0.2 = 500 ) .
ATP can not be stored , hence its consumption closely follows its synthesis .
However a total of around 5g of ATP is used by cell processes at any time in the body .
Key control points occur in enzymatic reactions that are so energetically favorable that they are effectively irreversible under physiological conditions .
In glycolysis , hexokinase is directly inhibited by its product , glucose-6-phosphate , and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself .
An additional level of regulation is introduced by the transport rates of ATP and NADH between the mitochondrial matrix and the cytoplasm .
In this way ATP transfers energy between spatially separate metabolic reactions .
ATP is the main energy source for the majority of cellular functions .
This includes the synthesis of macromolecules , including DNA and RNA ( see below ) , and proteins .
ATP also plays a critical role in the transport of macromolecules across cell membranes , e.g. exocytosis and endocytosis .
Roles in cell structure and locomotion ATP is critically involved in maintaining cell structure by facilitating assembly and disassembly of elements of the cytoskeleton .
In a related process , ATP is required for the shortening of actin and myosin filament crossbridges required for muscle contraction .
This latter process is one of the main energy requirements of animals and is essential for locomotion and respiration .
Cell signalling Extracellular signallingATP is also a signalling molecule .
ATP , ADP , or adenosine are recognised by purinergic receptors .
Purinoreceptors might be the most abundant receptors in mammalian tissues .
In humans , this signalling role is important in both the central and peripheral nervous system .
Activity-dependent release of ATP from synapses , axons and glia activates purinergic membrane receptors known as P2 .
The P2Y receptors are metabotropic , i.e. G protein-coupled and modulate mainly intracellular calcium and sometimes cyclic AMP levels .
All adenosine receptors were shown to activate at least one subfamily of mitogen-activated protein kinases .
The actions of adenosine are often antagonistic or synergistic to the actions of ATP .
In the CNS , adenosine has multiple functions , such as modulation of neural development , neuron and glial signalling and the control of innate and adaptive immune systems .
Intracellular signalingATP is critical in signal transduction processes .
It is used by kinase s as the source of phosphate groups in their phosphate transfer reactions .
Kinase activity on substrates such as proteins or membrane lipids are a common form of signal transduction .
Phosphorylation of a protein by a kinase can activate this cascade such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade .
This form of signal transduction is particularly important in brain function , although it is involved in the regulation of a multitude of other cellular processes .
All ribonucleotide reductase enzymes use a common sulfhydryl radical mechanism reliant on reactive cysteine residues that oxidize to form disulfide bond s in the course of the reaction .
RNR enzymes are recycled by reaction with thioredoxin or glutaredoxin .
The regulation of RNR and related enzymes maintains a balance of dNTPs relative to each other and relative to NTPs in the cell .
Regulation of or differential specificity of RNR has been proposed as a mechanism for alterations in the relative sizes of intracellular dNTP pools under cellular stress such as hypoxia .
The process is similar in DNA biosynthesis , except that ATP is reduced to the deoxyribonucleotide dATP , before incorporation into DNA .
ATP in complexes with proteins , in general , requires the presence of a divalent cation , almost always magnesium , which binds to the ATP phosphate groups .
The presence of magnesium ions can serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation .
ATP analogues Biochemistry laboratories often use in vitro studies to explore ATP-dependent molecular processes .
Enzyme inhibitor s of ATP-dependent enzymes such as kinase s are needed to examine the binding site s and transition state s involved in ATP-dependent reactions .
ATP analogs are also used in X-ray crystallography to determine a protein structure in complex with ATP , often together with other substrates .
Most useful ATP analogs can not be hydrolyzed as ATP would be ; instead they trap the enzyme in a structure closely related to the ATP-bound state .
In crystallographic studies , hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion .
However , caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs , since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable rates at high concentration .
Ægir ( Old Norse " sea " ) is a sea giant , god of the ocean and king of the sea creatures in Norse mythology .
He is also known for hosting elaborate parties for the gods .
Ægir 's servants are Fimafeng ( killed by Loki ) and Eldir .
Description While many versions of myths portray Ægir as a giant , it is curious that many do not .
In some texts , he is referred to as something older than the giants , and his origins are not really explained .
Snorri uses his visiting the Æsir as the frame of that section of the Prose Edda .
In Lokasenna , Ægir hosts a party for the gods where he provides the ale brewed in an enormous pot or cauldron provided by Thor and Týr .
The story of their obtaining the pot from the giant Hymir is told in Hymiskviða .
Ægir 's wife is Rán the sea goddess .
She is by Ægir mother of nine billow maidens , whose names are : See also Notes References
An antibacterial is an agent that inhibits bacterial growth or kills bacteria .
The term is often used synonym ously with the term antibiotic ( s ) .
This definition excluded substances that kill bacteria , but are not produced by microorganisms ( such as gastric juices and hydrogen peroxide ) .
It also excluded synthetic antibacterial compounds such as the sulfonamides .
In accordance with this , many antibacterial compounds are classified on the basis of chemical / biosynthetic origin into natural , semisynthetic , and synthetic .
History Before the early 20th century , treatments for infections were based primarily on medicinal folklore .
Mixtures with antimicrobial properties that were used in treatments of infections were described over 2000 years ago .
Louis Pasteur observed , " if we could intervene in the antagonism observed between some bacteria , it would offer perhaps the greatest hopes for therapeutics " .
Antibiosis was first described in 1877 in bacteria when Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch observed that an airborne bacillus could inhibit the growth of Bacillus anthracis .
These drugs were later renamed antibiotics by Selman Waksman , an American microbiologist , in 1942 .
John Tyndall first described antagonistic activities by fungi against bacteria in England in 1875 .
Synthetic antibiotic chemotherapy as a science and development of antibacterials began in Germany with Paul Ehrlich in the late 1880s .
Ehrlich noted certain dyes would color human , animal , or bacterial cells , while others did not .
After screening hundreds of dyes against various organisms , he discovered a medicinally useful drug , the synthetic antibacterial Salvarsan now called arsphenamine .
In 1895 , Vincenzo Tiberio , physician of the University of Naples discovered that a mold ( Penicillium ) in a water well had an antibacterial action .
Fleming postulated the effect was mediated by an antibacterial compound named penicillin , and that its antibacterial properties could be exploited for chemotherapy .
He initially characterized some of its biological properties , but he did not pursue its further development .
Domagk received the 1939 Nobel Prize for Medicine for his efforts .
Prontosil had a relatively broad effect against Gram-positive cocci , but not against enterobacteria .
Research was stimulated apace by its success .
The discovery and development of this sulfonamide drug opened the era of antibacterial .
In 1939 , coinciding with the start of World War II , Rene Dubos reported the discovery of the first naturally derived antibiotic , gramicidin from B. brevis .
It was one of the first commercially manufactured antibiotics universally and very effectively used to treat wounds and ulcers during World War II .
Research results obtained during that period were not shared between the Axis and the Allied powers during the war .
Florey and Chain succeeded in purifying the first penicillin , penicillin G procaine in 1942 , but it did not become widely available outside Allied military before 1945 .
The chemical structure of penicillin was determined by Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin in 1945 .
Purified penicillin displayed potent antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria and had low toxicity in humans .
Furthermore , its activity was not inhibited by biological constituents such as pus , unlike the synthetic sulfonamides .
For their discovery and development of penicillin as a therapeutic drug , Ernst Chain , Howard Florey , and Alexander Fleming shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Medicine .
Medical uses Pharmacodynamics The successful outcome of antimicrobial therapy with antibacterial compounds depends on several factors .
These include host defense mechanisms , the location of infection , and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the antibacterial .
A bactericidal activity of antibacterials may depend on the bacterial growth phase , and it often requires ongoing metabolic activity and division of bacterial cells .
These findings are based on laboratory studies , and in clinical settings have also been shown to eliminate bacterial infection .
Classes Antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action , chemical structure , or spectrum of activity .
Most target bacterial functions or growth processes .
Those that target protein synthesis ( aminoglycoside s , macrolide s , and tetracycline s ) are usually bacteriostatic .
Further categorization is based on their target specificity . "
Narrow-spectrum " antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria , such as Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria , whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria .
Following screening of antibacterials against a wide range of bacteria , production of the active compounds is carried out using fermentation , usually in strongly aerobic conditions .
However , some antibacterials have been associated with a range of adverse effects .
Side-effects range from mild to very serious depending on the antibiotics used , the microbial organisms targeted , and the individual patient .
Safety profiles of newer drugs are often not as well established as for those that have a long history of use .
Adverse effects range from fever and nausea to major allergic reactions , including photodermatitis and anaphylaxis .
Antibacterials can also affect the vaginal flora , and may lead to overgrowth of yeast species of the genus Candida in the vulvo-vaginal area .
Additional side-effects can result from interaction with other drugs , such as elevated risk of tendon damage from administration of a quinolone antibiotic with a systemic corticosteroid .
Some scientists have hypothesized that the indiscriminate use of antibiotics alter the host microbiota and this has been associated with chronic disease .
Clinicians have recommended that extra contraceptive measures be applied during therapies using antibacterials that are suspected to interact with oral contraceptives .
Alcohol Interactions between alcohol and certain antibacterials may occur and may cause side-effects and decreased effectiveness of antibacterial therapy .
Therefore , potential risks of side-effects and effectiveness depend on the type of antibacterial administered .
Despite the lack of a categorical counterindication , the belief that alcohol and antibacterials should never be mixed is widespread .
Other effects of alcohol on antibacterial activity include altered activity of the liver enzymes that break down the antibacterial compound .
Resistance The emergence of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon .
Emergence of resistance often reflects evolution ary processes that take place during antibacterial drug therapy .
The antibacterial treatment may select for bacterial strains with physiologically or genetically enhanced capacity to survive high doses of antibacterials .
Under certain conditions , it may result in preferential growth of resistant bacteria , while growth of susceptible bacteria is inhibited by the drug .
For example , antibacterial selection within whole bacterial populations for strains having previously acquired antibacterial-resistance genes was demonstrated in 1943 by the Luria – Delbrück experiment .
Survival of bacteria often results from an inheritable resistance .
Resistance to antibacterials also occurs through horizontal gene transfer .
Horizontal transfer is more likely to happen in locations of frequent antibiotic use .
Additional mutations , however , may compensate for this fitness cost and can aid the survival of these bacteria .
Antibiotics are natural products produced by microorganism to compete against other microorganisms .
Paleontological data show that both antibiotics and antibiotics resistance are ancient compounds and mechanisms .
Natural antibiotics are evolutionarily robust , i.e. , microorganisms are often unable to develop resistance against them .
Molecular data confirm this observation , showing that the evolution of bacterial proteins targeted by antibiotics is highly constrained compared with the evolution of other proteins .
Several molecular mechanisms of antibacterial resistance exist .
Intrinsic antibacterial resistance may be part of the genetic makeup of bacterial strains .
For example , an antibiotic target may be absent from the bacterial genome .
Acquired resistance results from a mutation in the bacterial chromosome or the acquisition of extra-chromosomal DNA .
Antibacterial-producing bacteria have evolved resistance mechanisms that have been shown to be similar to , and may have been transferred to , antibacterial-resistant strains .
The spread of antibacterial resistance often occurs through vertical transmission of mutations during growth and by genetic recombination of DNA by horizontal genetic exchange .
For instance , antibacterial resistance genes can be exchanged between different bacterial strains or species via plasmids that carry these resistance genes .
Plasmids that carry several different resistance genes can confer resistance to multiple antibacterials .
Cross-resistance to several antibacterials may also occur when a resistance mechanism encoded by a single gene conveys resistance to more than one antibacterial compound .
Antibacterial-resistant strains and species , sometimes referred to as " superbugs " , now contribute to the emergence of diseases that were for a while well controlled .
For example , emergent bacterial strains causing tuberculosis ( TB ) that are resistant to previously effective antibacterial treatments pose many therapeutic challenges .
Every year , nearly half a million new cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ( MDR-TB ) are estimated to occur worldwide .
For example , NDM-1 is a newly identified enzyme conveying bacterial resistance to a broad range of beta-lactam antibacterials .
The United Kingdom 's Health Protection Agency has stated that " most isolates with NDM-1 enzyme are resistant to all standard intravenous antibiotics for treatment of severe infections . "
Misuse Inappropriate antibacterial treatment and overuse of antibiotics have contributed to the emergence of antibacterial-resistant bacteria .
Self prescription of antibacterials is an example of misuse .
The overuse of antibacterials , like penicillin and erythromycin , have been associated with emerging antibacterial resistance since the 1950s .
Widespread usage of antibacterial drugs in hospitals has also been associated with increases in bacterial strains and species that no longer respond to treatment with the most common antibacterials .
Other forms of misuse include failure to take the entire prescribed course of the antibacterial , incorrect dosage and administration , or failure to rest for sufficient recovery .
Inappropriate antibacterial treatment , for example , is the prescription of antibacterials to treat viral infections such as the common cold .
One study on respiratory tract infection s found " physicians were more likely to prescribe antibiotics to patients who appeared to expect them " .
Multifactorial interventions aimed at both physicians and patients can reduce inappropriate prescription of antibiotics .
Several organizations concerned with antimicrobial resistance are lobbying to eliminate the unnecessary use of antibacterials .
The issues of misuse and overuse of antibiotics have been addressed by the formation of the U.S. Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance .
An NGO campaign group is Keep Antibiotics Working .
In France , an " Antibiotics are not automatic " government campaign started in 2002 and led to a marked reduction of unnecessary antibacterial prescriptions , especially in children .
Two federal bills ( S. 742 and H.R. 2562 ) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibacterials in US food animals were proposed , but have not passed .
There has been extensive use of antibiotics in animal husbandry .
Alternatives The increase in bacterial strains that are resistant to conventional antibacterial therapies has prompted the development of alternative strategies to treat bacterial diseases .
Resistance-modifying agents One strategy to address bacterial drug resistance is the discovery and application of compounds that modify resistance to common antibacterials .
For example , some resistance-modifying agents may inhibit multidrug resistance mechanisms , such as drug efflux from the cell , thus increasing the susceptibility of bacteria to an antibacterial .
Targets include : Metabolic stimuli such as sugar can help eradicate a certain type of antibiotic tolerant bacteria by keeping their metabolism active .
Phage therapy Phage therapy is the use of viruses that infect bacteria ( i.e. phages ) for the treatment of bacterial infections .
Phages are common in bacterial populations and control the growth of bacteria in many environments , including in the intestine , the ocean , and the soil .
Phage therapy was in use in the 1920s and 1930s in the US , Western Europe , and Eastern Europe .
These studies were performed mainly in the former Soviet Union , at the Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage , Microbiology and Virology , Republic of Georgia .
The development of antibacterial-resistant bacteria has sparked renewed interest in phage therapy in Western medicine .
Several companies ( e.g. , Intralytix , Novolytics , and Gangagen ) , universities , and foundations across the world now focus on phage therapies .
One concern with this therapeutic strategy is the use of genetically engineered viruses , which limits certain aspects of phage therapy .
Bacteriocin s Bacteriocins are peptide s that can be more readily engineered than small molecules , and are possible alternatives to conventional antibacterial compounds .
Different classes of bacteriocins have different potential as therapeutic agents .
Limitations of large-molecule antibacterials include reduced transport across membranes and within the human body .
For this reason , they are usually applied topically or gastrointestinally .
Chelation Chelation of micronutrients that are essential for bacterial growth to restrict pathogen spread in vivo might supplement some antibacterials .
For example , limiting the iron availability in the human body restricts bacterial proliferation .
Vaccines Vaccine s rely on immune modulation or augmentation .
Antibacterial vaccines have been responsible for a drastic reduction in global bacterial diseases .
Biotherapy Biotherapy may employ organisms , such as protozoa , to consume the bacterial pathogens .
Another such approach is maggot therapy .
Probiotics Probiotics consist of a live culture of bacteria , which may become established as competing symbionts , and inhibit or interfere with colonization by microbial pathogens .
Antimicrobial coatings Functionalization of antimicrobial surfaces can be used for sterilization , self-cleaning , and surface protection .
Antimicrobial copper alloy surfaces Copper-alloy surfaces have natural intrinsic properties to effectively and quickly destroy bacteria .
As a public hygienic measure in addition to regular cleaning , antimicrobial copper alloys are being installed in healthcare facilities and in a subway transit system .
Schwarzenegger served two terms as the 38th Governor of California from 2003 until 2011 .
Schwarzenegger began weight training at the age of 15 .
He won the Mr. Universe title at age 20 and went on to win the Mr. Olympia contest seven times .
Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent presence in bodybuilding and has written many books and articles on the sport .
Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film icon .
As a Republican , he was first elected on October 7 , 2003 , in a special recall election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis .
Schwarzenegger was sworn in on November 17 , 2003 , to serve the remainder of Davis 's term .
Schwarzenegger was sworn in for his second term on January 5 , 2007 .
Early life Schwarzenegger was born in Thal , Austria , a small village bordering the Styria n capital Graz , and was christened Arnold Alois Schwarzenegger .
His parents were the local police chief , Gustav Schwarzenegger ( 1907 – 1972 ) , and Aurelia ( née Jadrny ; 1922 – 1998 ) .
Gustav served in World War II , after he voluntarily applied to join the Nazi Party in 1938 .
Gustav served with the German Army as a Hauptfeldwebel of the Feldgendarmerie and was discharged in 1943 after contracting malaria .
They were married on October 20 , 1945 – Gustav was 38 , and Aurelia was 23-years-old .
He grew up in a Roman Catholic family who attended Mass every Sunday .
Gustav had a preference for his older son , Meinhard , over Arnold .
His favoritism was " strong and blatant , " which stemmed from unfounded suspicion that Arnold was not his biological child .
Schwarzenegger has said his father had " no patience for listening or understanding your problems . "
Schwarzenegger had a good relationship with his mother and kept in touch with her until her death .
Schwarzenegger 's father 's background received wide press attention during the 2003 California recall campaign .
At school , Schwarzenegger was apparently in the middle but stood out for his " cheerful , good-humored and exuberant " character .
Money was a problem in their household ; Schwarzenegger recalled that one of the highlights of his youth was when the family bought a refrigerator .
As a boy , Schwarzenegger played several sports , heavily influenced by his father .
He picked up his first barbell in 1960 , when his football ( soccer ) coach took his team to a local gym .
At the age of 14 , he chose bodybuilding over football as a career .
During a speech in 2001 , he said , " My own plan formed when I was 14 years old .
My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he was .
My mother wanted me to go to trade school . "
When Reeves died in 2000 , Schwarzenegger fondly remembered him : " As a teenager , I grew up with Steve Reeves .
His remarkable accomplishments allowed me a sense of what was possible , when others around me did n't always understand my dreams .
Steve Reeves has been part of everything I 've ever been fortunate enough to achieve . "
In 1961 , Schwarzenegger met former Mr. Austria Kurt Marnul , who invited him to train at the gym in Graz .
He was so dedicated as a youngster that he broke into the local gym on weekends , when it was usually closed , so that he could train . "
The first real movie I saw , that I distinctly remember , was a John Wayne movie . "
In 1971 , his brother , Meinhard , died in a car accident .
Meinhard had been drinking and was killed instantly .
Schwarzenegger did not attend his funeral .
Meinhard was due to marry Erika Knapp , and the couple had a three-year-old son , Patrick .
Schwarzenegger would pay for Patrick 's education and help him to immigrate to the United States .
Gustav died the following year from a stroke .
In Pumping Iron , Schwarzenegger claimed that he did not attend his father 's funeral because he was training for a bodybuilding contest .
Barbara Baker , his first serious girlfriend , has said he informed her of his father 's death without emotion and that he never spoke of his brother .
Over time , he has given at least three versions of why he was absent from his father 's funeral .
I was hit with belts .
So was the kid next door .
It was just the way it was .
Many of the children I 've seen were broken by their parents , which was the German-Austrian mentality .
They did n't want to create an individual .
It was all about conforming .
I was one who did not conform , and whose will could not be broken .
Therefore , I became a rebel .
I want to be rich .
I want to be somebody . ' "
Early adulthood Schwarzenegger served in the Austrian Army in 1965 to fulfill the one year of service required at the time of all 18-year-old Austrian males .
During his army service , he won the Junior Mr. Europe contest .
He won another bodybuilding contest in Graz , at Steirer Hof Hotel ( where he had placed second ) .
He was voted best built man of Europe , which made him famous . "
The Mr. Universe title was my ticket to America – the land of opportunity , where I could become a star and get rich . "
Schwarzenegger made his first plane trip in 1966 , attending the NABBA Mr. Universe competition in London .
He would come in second in the Mr. Universe competition , not having the muscle definition of American winner Chester Yorton .
Charles " Wag " Bennett , one of the judges at the 1966 competition , was impressed with Schwarzenegger and he offered to coach him .
As Schwarzenegger had little money , Bennett invited him to stay in his crowded family home above one of his two gyms in Forest Gate , London , England .
Staying in the East End of London helped Schwarzenegger improve his rudimentary grasp of the English language .
Also in 1966 , Schwarzenegger had the opportunity to meet childhood idol Reg Park , who became his friend and mentor .
The training paid off and , in 1967 , Schwarzenegger won the title for the first time , becoming the youngest ever Mr. Universe at the age of 20 .
He would go on to win the title a further three times .
He frequently told Roger C. Field , a friend in Munich at that time , " I 'm going to become the greatest actor ! "
There he trained at Gold 's Gym in Venice , Los Angeles , California , under Joe Weider .
From 1970 to 1974 , one of Schwarzenegger 's weight training partners was Ric Drasin , a professional wrestler who designed the original Gold 's Gym logo in 1973 .
Schwarzenegger also became good friends with professional wrestler " Superstar " Billy Graham .
In 1977 , Schwarzenegger 's autobiography/weight-training guide Arnold : The Education of a Bodybuilder was published and became a huge success .
Bodybuilding career Schwarzenegger is considered among the most important figures in the history of bodybuilding , and his legacy is commemorated in the Arnold Classic annual bodybuilding competition .
Schwarzenegger has remained a prominent face in the bodybuilding sport long after his retirement , in part because of his ownership of gyms and fitness magazines .
He has presided over numerous contests and awards shows .
For many years , he wrote a monthly column for the bodybuilding magazines Muscle & Fitness and Flex .
Shortly after being elected Governor , he was appointed executive editor of both magazines , in a largely symbolic capacity .
The magazines agreed to donate $ 250,000 a year to the Governor 's various physical fitness initiatives .
Consequently , Schwarzenegger relinquished the executive editor role in 2005 .
The magazine MuscleMag International has a monthly two-page article on him , and refers to him as " The King " .
One of the first competitions he won was the Junior Mr. Europe contest in 1965 .
He won Mr. Europe the following year , at age 19 .
He would go on to compete in , and win , many bodybuilding contests .
Schwarzenegger official height of 6 ' 2 " ( 1.88 m ) has been brought into question by several articles .
However , in 1988 both the Daily Mail and Time Out magazine mentioned that Schwarzenegger appeared noticeably shorter .
Prior to running for Governor , Schwarzenegger 's height was once again questioned in an article by the Chicago Reader .
As Governor , Schwarzenegger engaged in a light-hearted exchange with Assemblyman Herb Wesson over their heights .
Schwarzenegger retaliated by placing a pillow stitched with the words " Need a lift ? "
on the five-foot-five inch ( 165 cm ) Wesson 's chair before a negotiating session in his office .
Bob Mulholland also claimed Arnold was 5 ' 10 " ( 1.78 m ) and that he wore risers in his boots .
Men 's Health magazine has estimated his height at 5 ' 10 " .
Schwarzenegger continues to work out even today .
When asked about his personal training during the 2011 Arnold Classic he said that he was still working out a half an hour with weights every day .
Powerlifting/weightlifting During Arnold 's early years in bodybuilding , he also competed in several Olympic weightlifting and powerlifting contests .
Arnold won two weightlifting contests in 1964 and 1965 , as well as two powerlifting contests in 1966 and 1968 .
In 1967 , Schwarzenegger competed in and won the Munich stone-lifting contest , in which a stone weighing 508 German pounds ( 254 kg/560 lbs . )
is lifted between the legs while standing on two foot rests .
Personal records Mr. Olympia Schwarzenegger 's goal was to become the greatest bodybuilder in the world , which meant becoming Mr. Olympia .
His first attempt was in 1969 , when he lost to three-time champion Sergio Oliva .
He continued his winning streak in the 1971 – 74 competitions .
In 1975 , Schwarzenegger was once again in top form , and won the title for the sixth consecutive time , beating Franco Columbu .
After the 1975 Mr. Olympia contest , Schwarzenegger announced his retirement from professional bodybuilding .
Schwarzenegger had only three months to prepare for the competition , after losing significant weight to appear in the film Stay Hungry with Jeff Bridges .
Lou Ferrigno proved not to be a threat , and a lighter-than-usual Schwarzenegger convincingly won the 1975 Mr. Olympia .
Schwarzenegger came out of retirement , however , to compete in the 1980 Mr. Olympia .
He kept this plan a secret , in the event that a training accident would prevent his entry and cause him to lose face .
Schwarzenegger ended up winning the event with only seven weeks of preparation .
After being declared Mr. Olympia for a seventh time , Schwarzenegger then officially retired from competition .
I did not use them for muscle growth , but rather for muscle maintenance when cutting up . "
He has called the drugs " tissue building . "
As the doctor had never examined him personally , Schwarzenegger collected a US$ 10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court .
In 1999 , Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with The Globe , a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder 's future health .
Credited under the name " Arnold Strong , " his accent in the film was so thick that his lines were dubbed after production .
Schwarzenegger has discussed his early struggles in developing his acting career . "
You name it , and they told me I had to change it .
Basically , everywhere I turned , I was told that I had no chance . "
Schwarzenegger drew attention and boosted his profile in the bodybuilding film Pumping Iron ( 1977 ) , elements of which were dramatized .
In 1991 , Schwarzenegger purchased the rights to the film , its outtakes , and associated still photography .
Schwarzenegger auditioned for the title role of The Incredible Hulk , but did not win the role because of his height .
Later , Lou Ferrigno got the part of Dr. David Banner 's alter ego .
Schwarzenegger appeared with Kirk Douglas and Ann-Margret in the 1979 comedy The Villain .
In 1980 he starred in a biographical film of the 1950s actress Jayne Mansfield as Mansfield 's husband , Mickey Hargitay .
Action superstar Schwarzenegger 's breakthrough film was the sword-and-sorcery epic Conan the Barbarian in 1982 , which was a box-office hit .
This was followed by a sequel , Conan the Destroyer in 1984 , although it was not as successful as its predecessor .
In 1983 , Schwarzenegger starred in the promotional video " Carnival in Rio " .
Following The Terminator , Schwarzenegger made Red Sonja in 1985 .
During the 1980s , audiences had an appetite for action films , with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars .
Schwarzenegger 's roles reflected his sense of humor , separating his roles from more serious action hero fare .
Twins ( 1988 ) , a comedy with Danny DeVito also proved successful .
Kindergarten Cop ( 1990 ) reunited him with director Ivan Reitman , who directed him in Twins .
He has not directed since .
Schwarzenegger 's commercial peak was his return as the title character in 1991 's Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , which was the highest-grossing film of 1991 .
In 1993 , the National Association of Theatre Owners named him the " International Star of the Decade . "
His next film project , the 1993 self-aware action comedy spoof Last Action Hero was released opposite Jurassic Park , and did not do well at the box office .
This film brought Schwarzenegger his second Golden Globe nomination , this time for Best Actor – Musical or Comedy .
This was his final film before taking time to recuperate from a back injury .
Following the critical failure of Batman & Robin , Schwarzenegger 's film career and box office prominence went into decline .
Schwarzenegger reportedly said he was flattered , but thought the money would be better spent on social projects and the Special Olympics .
In 2005 , he appeared as himself in the film The Kid & I .
Schwarzenegger voiced Baron von Steuben in Episode 24 ( " Valley Forge " ) of Liberty 's Kids .
Schwarzenegger had been rumored to be appearing in Terminator Salvation as the original T-800 model , alongside Roland Kickinger .
Schwarzenegger appeared in Sylvester Stallone 's The Expendables , where he made a cameo appearance , in a scene alongside Stallone and Bruce Willis .
The character was later revealed to be the Governator , star of the comic book and animated series of the same name .
Schwarzenegger inspired the character and co-developed it with Stan Lee , who would have produced the series .
Schwarzenegger would have voiced the Governator .
On May 20 , 2011 , Schwarzenegger 's entertainment counsel announced that all movie projects currently in development were being halted . "
... Schwarzenegger is focusing on personal matters and is not willing to commit to any production schedules or timelines . "
However , the Daily Star reported on May 29 that Schwarzenegger had been offered $ 40 million to star in two Terminator films .
On July 11 , 2011 , it was announced that Schwarzenegger is considering a comeback film despite his legal problems .
Schwarzenegger appeared in The Expendables 2 ( 2012 ) , in which he had a larger role than in the first film .
He starred in The Last Stand as a Los Angeles cop-turned-sheriff , and will reprise his role as Conan the Barbarian in the 2014 film The Legend of Conan .
Political career Early politics Schwarzenegger has been a registered Republican for many years .
He first came to wide public notice as a Republican during the 1988 Presidential election , accompanying then-Vice President George H.W. Bush at a campaign rally .
Schwarzenegger 's first political appointment was as chairman of the President 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports , on which he served from 1990 to 1993 .
He was nominated by George H. W. Bush , who dubbed him " Conan the Republican " .
He later served as Chairman for the California Governor 's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under Governor Pete Wilson .
In an interview with Talk magazine in late 1999 , Schwarzenegger was asked if he thought of running for office .
He replied , " I think about it many times .
The possibility is there , because I feel it inside . "
The Hollywood Reporter claimed shortly after that Schwarzenegger sought to end speculation that he might run for governor of California .
Following his initial comments , Schwarzenegger said , " I 'm in show business – I am in the middle of my career .
Why would I go away from that and jump into something else ? "
Schwarzenegger declined to participate in several debates with other recall replacement candidates , and appeared in only one debate on September 24 , 2003 .
Schwarzenegger was elected Governor of California under the second question on the ballot with 48.6 % of the vote to choose a successor to Davis .
Schwarzenegger defeated Democrat Cruz Bustamante , fellow Republican Tom McClintock , and others .
His nearest rival , Bustamante , received 31 % of the vote .
In total , Schwarzenegger won the election by about 1.3 million votes .
Under the regulations of the California Constitution , no runoff election was required .
Schwarzenegger was the second foreign-born governor of California after Irish-born Governor John G. Downey in 1862 .
As soon as Schwarzenegger was elected governor , Willie Brown said he would start a drive to recall the governor .
Schwarzenegger was equally entrenched in what he considered to be his mandate in cleaning up gridlock .
Key among his reckoning with political realities was a special election he called in November 2005 , in which four ballot measures he sponsored were defeated .
Schwarzenegger accepted personal responsibility for the defeats and vowed to continue to seek consensus for the people of California .
He would later comment that " no one could win if the opposition raised 160 million dollars to defeat you " .
Schwarzenegger then went against the advice of fellow Republican strategists and appointed a Democrat , Susan Kennedy , as his Chief of Staff .
Schwarzenegger gradually moved towards a more politically moderate position , determined to build a winning legacy with only a short time to go until the next gubernatorial election .
Schwarzenegger ran for re-election against Democrat Phil Angelides , the California State Treasurer , in the 2006 elections , held on November 7 , 2006 .
In recent years , many commentators have seen Schwarzenegger as moving away from the right and towards the center of the political spectrum .
I would say center-left " .
It was rumored that Schwarzenegger might run for the United States Senate in 2010 , as his governorship would be term-limited by that time .
This turned out to be false .
I think it is because I saw leaders use 100 % of their potential – I was always fascinated by people in control of other people . "
Schwarzenegger has said that it was never his intention to enter politics , but he says , " I married into a political family .
You get together with them and you hear about policy , about reaching out to help people .
I was exposed to the idea of being a public servant and Eunice and Sargent Shriver became my heroes . "
Eunice Kennedy Shriver was sister of John F. Kennedy , and mother-in-law to Schwarzenegger ; Sargent Shriver is husband to Eunice and father-in-law to Schwarzenegger .
He can not run for president as he is not a natural born citizen of the United States .
Schwarzenegger is a dual Austria/United States citizen .
He holds Austrian citizenship by birth and has held U.S. citizenship since becoming naturalized in 1983 .
Because of his personal wealth from his acting career , Schwarzenegger did not accept his governor 's salary of $ 175,000 per year .
Giuliani dropped out of the Presidential race on January 30 , 2008 , largely because of a poor showing in Florida , and endorsed McCain .
Later that night , Schwarzenegger was in the audience at a Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California .
The following day , he endorsed McCain , joking , " It 's Rudy 's fault ! "
( in reference to his friendships with both candidates and that he could not make up his mind ) .
Schwarzenegger 's endorsement was thought to be a boost for Senator McCain 's campaign ; both spoke about their concerns for the environment and economy .
Governor Schwarzenegger played a significant role in opposing Proposition 66 , a proposed amendment of the Californian Three Strikes Law , in November 2004 .
This amendment would have required the third felony to be either violent or serious to mandate a 25-years-to-life sentence .
In the last week before the ballot , Schwarzenegger launched an intensive campaign against Proposition 66 .
He stated that " it would release 26,000 dangerous criminals and rapists " .
Allegations of sexual misconduct During his initial campaign for governor , allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger , dubbed " Gropegate " .
Three of the women claimed he had grabbed their breasts , a fourth said he placed his hand under her skirt on her buttock .
This came after an interview in adult magazine Oui from 1977 surfaced , in which Schwarzenegger discussed attending sexual orgies and using substances such as marijuana .
Schwarzenegger is shown smoking a marijuana joint after winning Mr. Olympia in the 1975 documentary film Pumping Iron .
In an interview with GQ magazine in October 2007 , Schwarzenegger said , " [ Marijuana ] is not a drug .
It 's a leaf .
My drug was pumping iron , trust me . "
His spokesperson later said the comment was meant to be a joke .
British television personality Anna Richardson settled a libel lawsuit in August 2006 against Schwarzenegger , his top aide , Sean Walsh , and his publicist , Sheryl Main .
A joint statement read : " The parties are content to put this matter behind them and are pleased that this legal dispute has now been settled . "
Richardson claimed they tried to tarnish her reputation by dismissing her allegations that Schwarzenegger touched her breast during a press event for The 6th Day in London .
She claimed Walsh and Main libeled her in a Los Angeles Times article when they contended she encouraged his behavior .
Citizenship In 2005 , Peter Pilz , from the Austrian Green Party , demanded that parliament revoke Schwarzenegger 's Austrian citizenship .
Schwarzenegger explained his actions by referring to the fact that his only duty as Governor of California was to prevent an error in the judicial system .
Environmental record On September 27 , 2006 Schwarzenegger signed a bill creating the nation 's first cap on greenhouse gas emissions .
The law set new regulations on the amount of emissions utilities , refineries and manufacturing plants are allowed to release into the atmosphere .
The two bills are part of a plan to reduce California 's emissions by 25 percent to 1990s levels by 2020 .
In 2005 , Schwarzenegger issued an executive order calling to reduce greenhouse gases to 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
Schwarzenegger signed another executive order on October 17 , 2006 allowing California to work with the Northeast 's Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative .
They plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by issuing a limited amount of carbon credits to each power plant in participating states .
Any power plants that exceed emissions for the amount of carbon credits will have to purchase more credits to cover the difference .
The plan took effect in 2009 .
In addition to using his political power to fight global warming , the governor has taken steps at his home to reduce his personal carbon footprint .
Schwarzenegger has adapted one of his Hummers to run on hydrogen and another to run on biofuels .
He has also installed solar panels to heat his home .

Adam Smith ( 5 June 1723 OS – 17 July 1790 ) was a Scottish moral philosopher and a pioneer of political economy .
The latter , usually abbreviated as The Wealth of Nations , is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics .
Smith is cited as the " father of modern economics " and is still among the most influential thinkers in the field of economics today .
In 2009 , Smith was named among the " Greatest Scots " of all time , in a vote run by Scottish television channel STV .
After graduating , he delivered a successful series of public lectures at the University of Edinburgh , leading him to collaborate with David Hume during the Scottish Enlightenment .
Smith obtained a professorship at Glasgow teaching moral philosophy , and during this time he wrote and published The Theory of Moral Sentiments .
In his later life , he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout Europe , where he met other intellectual leaders of his day .
Smith then returned home and spent the next ten years writing The Wealth of Nations , publishing it in 1776 .
He died in 1790 at the age of 67 .
Biography Early life Smith was born in Kirkcaldy , Fife , Scotland .
Although the exact date of Smith 's birth is unknown , his baptism was recorded on 5 June 1723 at Kirkcaldy .
Smith was close to his mother , who likely encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions .
While there , Smith studied Latin , mathematics , history , and writing .
Formal education Smith entered the University of Glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under Francis Hutcheson .
Here , Smith developed his passion for liberty , reason , and free speech .
In 1740 Smith was awarded the Snell exhibition and left to attend Balliol College , Oxford .
Smith considered the teaching at Glasgow far superior to that at Oxford , which he found intellectually stifling .
According to William Robert Scott , " The Oxford of [ Smith 's ] time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework . "
Nevertheless , Smith took the opportunity while at Oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large Oxford library .
When Smith was not studying on his own , his time at Oxford was not a happy one , according to his letters .
Near the end of his time at Oxford , Smith began suffering from shaking fits , probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown .
He left Oxford University in 1746 , before his scholarship ended .
Smith 's discontent at Oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in Glasgow , Francis Hutcheson .
His lectures endeavored not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives , appropriately acquiring the epithet , the preacher of philosophy .
Teaching career Smith began delivering public lectures in 1748 in University of Edinburgh , sponsored by the Philosophical Society of Edinburgh under the patronage of Lord Kames .
His lecture topics included rhetoric and belles-lettres , and later the subject of " the progress of opulence " .
On this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of " the obvious and simple system of natural liberty " .
While Smith was not adept at public speaking , his lectures met with success .
In 1750 , he met the philosopher David Hume , who was his senior by more than a decade .
When the head of Moral Philosophy died the next year , Smith took over the position .
Smith published The Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759 , embodying some of his Glasgow lectures .
This work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator , or the individual and other members of society .
Smith defined " mutual sympathy " as the basis of moral sentiments .
In 1762 , the University of Glasgow conferred on Smith the title of Doctor of Laws ( LL .
Tutoring and travels Smith 's tutoring job entailed touring Europe with Scott , during which time he educated Scott on a variety of subjects – such as proper Polish .
He was paid £ 300 per year ( plus expenses ) along with a £ 300 per year pension ; roughly twice his former income as a teacher .
Smith first travelled as a tutor to Toulouse , France , where he stayed for one and a half years .
After touring the south of France , the group moved to Geneva , where Smith met with the philosopher Voltaire .
